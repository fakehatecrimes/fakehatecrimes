T*(Foreword)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This book grew out of a research project I began in 1988 when the issue of)Tj
T*(racist and anti-Semitic hoaxes first came to my attention in a serious way. I)Tj
T*(had learned in talking with a former associate in the civil rights movement of)Tj
T*(the 1960s that a cross-burning I had always assumed was done by white racists)Tj
T*(was, in fact, done by civil rights workers. This aroused my curiosity, and more)Tj
T*(extensive probing convinced me that it may not be an uncommon occurrence.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I quickly discovered that there were almost no sources of information on the)Tj
T*(subject of racist and anti-Semitic hoaxes. Rightwing groups, whom one might)Tj
T*(suspect would keep tabs on this, were rendered almost useless by their)Tj
T*(conspiratorial approach to the subject. The various black and Jewish groups were)Tj
T*(reluctant to discuss the issue. It was evidently a subject that had to be)Tj
T*(researched from scratch.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In 1989 I established the "Hoaxer Project" to bring together information on the)Tj
T*(subject. I managed to collect a number of newspaper clippings and in 1990)Tj
T*(published a small report entitled The Hoaxer Project Report., Altogether some)Tj
T*(5,500 copies of that report were circulated. A few readers began sending me)Tj
T*(clippings of hoaxes that actually made the newspapers as well as their own)Tj
T*(accounts of incidents they knew or suspected were hoaxes.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In time this added up to some 300 documented incidents from which the cases)Tj
T*(described in this book were drawn. I did not have the resources of a clipping)Tj
T*(service or a large network of "monitors" to assist me. If I had, this)Tj
T*(compilation might be many times as large.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Obviously, hoaxers are people who have exercised pretty bad judgment. Their acts)Tj
T*(may have been hurtful to others and they have usually violated various laws.)Tj
T*(Nevertheless I think it's important to avoid the concept of "good guys" and "bad)Tj
T*(guys" when considering this issue. What we seem to have instead are those who)Tj
T*(are simply responding to an opportunity.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Whenever an abstract ideal acquires the moral urgency that racial equality or)Tj
T*(opposition to "bigotry" has today, it's only a matter of time until we find)Tj

T*(individuals for whom the noble end justifies the questionable means. The)Tj
T*(militant, moralizing fanatic -- g quick to compromise important principles in)Tj
T*(order to enjoy the flush of righteousness -- is the stumbling block which any)Tj
T*(reasonable resolution of racial/ethnic problems must overcome.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Further, in my experience, this uncompromising behavior is often a way of)Tj
T*(compensating for a hidden inner ambivalence. The social psychologist Harold D.)Tj
T*(Lasswell has written that "dogma is a defensive reaction in the mind of the)Tj
T*(theorist, but doubt of which he is unaware.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This unconscious ambivalence appears to explain the willingness of many)Tj
T*(so-called "anti-racists" to justify and practice a kind of reverse racism or)Tj
T*("counter-bigotry." This manifests itself in the "good" discrimination of)Tj
T*(affirmative action and race-preferential policies, as well as in rationalizing)Tj
T*(prejudicial and stereotyping statements about white people.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Twenty years ago one couldn't have said this, but today discrimination in)Tj
T*(schools, housing, jobs and government is minimal. Institutional racism is)Tj
T*(virtually gone. In its place, a series of preferential policies are firmly)Tj
T*(established.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In recent years "anti-racists" have proclaimed that virtually every behavior and)Tj
T*(institution in our society is covertly racist. Anti-racism has become a small)Tj
T*(industry in the United States. Entire career fields are built around defining)Tj
T*(and combatting "racism" in one form or another. As individual problems are)Tj
T*(solved and offensive behaviors disappear, the definition of racism is broadened)Tj
T*(again and again to include more and more behaviors, hence we have the problem of)Tj
T*("increasing" bigotry and intolerance. I suspect the last thing many professional)Tj
T*(anti-racists want is a truly race-neutral society. They have developed a vested)Tj
T*(interest in the continuation of the problem, a kind of "co-dependency")Tj
T*(relationship, if you will.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It's no great surprise that a bright, socially-conscious individual would)Tj
T*(realize quite on his or her own that there's nothing like some racist graffiti)Tj
T*(or some other "hate crime" to invigorate the militants, and what the hell, it's)Tj
T*(for a good cause - right? Americans are not known for their ability to defer)Tj
T*(gratification for long. Hence, the racist or anti-Semitic hoax. It's as easy as)Tj
T*(apple pie.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Consider a college campus boiling with racial and gender sensitivity, with)Tj
T*(courses in victimization, organizations for victims, a constant barrage of)Tj
T*(victimization propaganda -- but no immediate and palpable victims. "Anti-racist")Tj
T*(vigilantes with no racists \(or misogynists and homophobes\) to hang had better)Tj
T*(get busy and make some, and as we see, they often do.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(What I see happening with hoaxes is a kind of "market" process: the frequency of)Tj
T*(hoaxes increases with their utility in accomplishing desired ends. When the)Tj
T*("market" or payoff for victimization goes up, the temptation to create)Tj
T*(victimization where none exists is very strong and the temptation of exaggerate)Tj
T*(minor cases of alleged victimization is even stronger.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Conversely, as the number of hoaxes increases \(assuming they are reported\) a)Tj
T*(greater skepticism toward unproven and marginal victimization claims will)Tj
T*(probably increase as well, and hoaxes will become less effective. It's pretty)Tj
T*(much a matter of supply and demand.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Concerning the text, it's important to realize that in some cases there may have)Tj
T*(been further developments in some of the incidents I have covered. If a)Tj
T*(particular case is important to you, I advise that you attempt to determine its)Tj
T*(current status. Also, for the most part I relied on journalistic accounts for my)Tj

T*(Chapter 1)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Scope of the Problem)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In January 1994 the Anti-Defamation League, an organization devoted to defending)Tj
T*(the interests of Jews, reported that anti-Semitic acts against people and)Tj
T*(property rose 8 percent in the United States during 1993. The ADL also reported)Tj
T*(1,867 incidents involving threats, harassment, assaults, vandalism, graffiti and)Tj
T*(other behaviors \(one incident per 139,000 Americans\). These included one arson,)Tj
T*(one attempted arson, one bombing and one attempted bombing.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL annual audit claimed 788 acts of vandalism \(one per 330,000 Americans or)Tj
T*(stight1y over 2 per day in a country of 260,000,000\) down 8 percent from the)Tj
T*(previous year. 0f those, 325 involved graffiti on bridges, buildings and signs,)Tj
T*(i.e., expressions of values, opinions and beliefs on private property.)Tj
T*(Nationwide, according to the ADL, in 1993 there were only sixty arrests for any)Tj
T*(of this activity, revealing that the vast majority of the incidents were)Tj
T*(unsolved and no identified culprit was apprehended. Vandalism is almost always a)Tj
T*(criminal offense and could be prosecuted if there were anyone to prosecute. The)Tj
T*(ADL, of course, lobbies hard for prosecution when the perpetrators are)Tj
T*(identified.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On the other hand, the ADL's 1992 annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents)Tj
T*(reported an 8 percent decline from 1991. Thus, the 1993 increase only served to)Tj
T*(bring the number of incidents back to its 1991 level. A total of 1,730 incidents)Tj
T*(were reported in 1992, including 28 serious cases such as arson, attempted)Tj
T*(arson, cemetery desecration and synagogue bombings. Forty+four percent of the)Tj
T*(incidents took place in public areas, such as public schools or office)Tj
T*(buildings.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(B'nai B'rith, Canada's League for Human Rights, the Canadian equivalent of the)Tj
T*(ADL, also reported a decline in anti-Semitic incidents in its 1992 audit. A)Tj
T*(total of 196 incidents occurred nationwide in 1992 \(one per 196,000 Canadians\),)Tj
T*(down 22 percent from 1991. Half of the incidents occurred in Toronto, which has)Tj
T*(the largest Jewish population in Canada.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL audit, as always, included many incidents that are not crimes, only)Tj
T*(personal insults, such as one person telling another off and making reference to)Tj
T*(their ethnic identity in the process. ADL National Chairman, Melvin Salberg,)Tj
T*(said that he found this "very disturbing and of great concern. This 'in your)Tj
T*(face' anti-Semitism may signal a new tendency to engage in direct confrontations)Tj
T*(with Jews and further erodes the taboo against open bigotry.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The audit also includes incidents where mailings are identified on the basis of)Tj
T*(their alleged anti-Semitic content, public expressions of identification with)Tj
T*(Arab radicals in Israel's occupied territories, distribution of holocaust)Tj
T*(revisionist material on the campus, and other activities protected under the)Tj
T*(First Amendment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL reported 1,879 anti-Semitic incidents in 1991.5 This was up from 1,685)Tj
T*(incidents recorded by the ADL in 1990, and 1,432 in 1989. Bona fide anti-Semitic)Tj

T*(ADL reported only 30 such cases in 1990 and 60 in 1991.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(No disrespect is intended, and I'm sure such incidents were distressing to those)Tj
T*(who experienced them, but these figures do not support the claim of a serious)Tj
T*(and significant trend toward anti-Semitism in a nation of more than a quarter)Tj
T*(billion people.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The vast majority of these incidents are on the order of simple graffiti, minor)Tj
T*(vandalism, verbal altercations or telephone harassment. Most remain unsolved in)Tj
T*(that no perpetrator was ever identified, let alone prosecuted. Where the)Tj
T*(perpetrator is identified, most of these offenses are committed by juveniles)Tj
T*(under 18. Many of the unsolved cases may be hoaxes. 1 A single hoaxer with a can)Tj
T*(of spray paint or a pocket full of quarters can significantly inflate)Tj
T*(statistics.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL compiled these statistics through a nationwide network of regional)Tj
T*(offices, local "monitors," clipping services, and reports from police agencies.)Tj
T*(In addition, the ADL actually solicited reports of anti-Semitic incidents by)Tj
T*(circulating questionnaires to its own mailing list - hardly a disinterested)Tj
T*(group. This practice raises serious doubts about statistics c0mpited by an)Tj
T*(interested organization eager to promote its own agenda. g According to Leonard)Tj
T*(Larson, syndicated columnist for Scripps Howard News Service, the ADL's)Tj
T*(statistics may be questioned on other grounds as well. Larson notes that among)Tj
T*(the anti-Semitic incidents listed in an annual audit is a case where individuals)Tj
T*(in Boston displayed "pro-Palestinian/ antiIsrael graffiti" in the subways-)Tj
T*(Larson adds that the ADL considered these and other incidents anti-Semitic)Tj
T*(because they recount brutal acts of repression against Palestinians by the)Tj
T*(Israeli government. "An obvious intent here is to use intimidation to silence)Tj
T*(criticism of Israel's political and military conduct," Larson says.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Anti-Semitism: On The Rise?)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Of course, there is disagreement whether anti-Semitism is on the rise i or in)Tj
T*(decline. In November, 1991, the ADL held a two-day conference in Montreal which)Tj
T*(produced a consensus that "Anti-Semitism, both in North America and abroad is on)Tj
T*(the rise, and Jews have to stop keeping quiet about it.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(According to ADL executive director Abraham Foxman "..we have reason to be)Tj
T*(concerned and frightened by what seems to be a rising tide of anti-Semitism here)Tj
T*(and around the world....The virus has become more active. The restraints and)Tj
T*(taboos have disappeared.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In January 1992, however, another Jewish organization released its report,)Tj
T*(based on detailed survey data, that racial and religious tolerance is increasing)Tj
T*(and anti-Semitism is declining The American Jewish Committee report cited data,)Tj
T*(for example, which showed that in 1968, 59 percent of Gallup poll respondents)Tj
T*(expressed approval of marriage between Jews and non-Jews, whine in 1983, 77)Tj
T*(percent approved. According to media reports,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("The study found that anti-Jewish attitudes are at historic lows...Jews were)Tj
T*(even perceived in the 1990 general Social Survey as leading whites in general,)Tj
T*(Southern whites, Asians Americans, Hispanic-Americans and blacks in terms of who)Tj
T*(was regarded as harder working, richer, less prone to violence, more)Tj
T*(self-supporting and more intelligent.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The American Jewish Committee said that "the report should come at a relief to)Tj
T*(American Jews who fear a possible increase in anti-Semitism." This was not the)Tj
T*(first time in recent years serious differences over the prevalence of)Tj

T*(Anti-Defamation League and the Simon Weisenthal Center were at loggerheads over)Tj
T*(the issue.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL reported a 15 percent decline in anti-Semitic incidents in 1982 from the)Tj
T*(previous year, and out of 829 incidents, only 197 involved vandalism at Jewish)Tj
T*(synagogues, temples and community centers. The Wiesenthal Center, on the other)Tj
T*(hand, claimed a total of over a thousand vandalism cases, asserting, for)Tj
T*(instance, that in the last three years 57 percent of the synagogues in New York)Tj
T*(had been vandalized. These are not trivial differences.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In 1988, J. J. Goldberg, writing in Jewish Week, observed)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("a majority of the Jewish community's professional experts insist there is no)Tj
T*(detectable jump either in the rate of anti-Semitic acts or in the level of)Tj
T*(anti4Jewish feeling among the American population at large.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Goldberg's article quotes sociologist Steven M. Cohen, who believes that an)Tj
T*(increase in reporting anti-Semitic incidents fuels the claim that they are)Tj
T*(increasing. Cohen says,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("Jews are more sensitive to anti-Semitism than they've been in the past. So one)Tj
T*(of the reasons we may be seeing a rise in reports of anti-Semitism is that local)Tj
T*(people see incidents as anti-Semitic more readily. And secondly, the national)Tj
T*(media give it more prominence than in the past... You have to conclude that to)Tj
T*(some degree, Jews construct antiSemitism.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Five years later, writing in The New Republic, Goldberg said that the very)Tj
T*(definition of "anti-Semitism" had been changed by some Jewish groups in order to)Tj
T*(support their agenda.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("Before World War II, anti-Semitism was defined as wanting to harm Jews.i In the)Tj
T*(post-war era, it was broadened to include prejudice that might lead one to wish)Tj
T*(Jews harm. More recently, it's come to mean any stereotype - or disagreement -)Tj
T*(with the Jewish community. The very term has become a weapon.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Goldberg commented on the hyping of anti-Semitism by Jewish organizations,)Tj
T*(noting that people give money when motivated by fear,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("In private, some Jewish agency staffers insist the alarmist tone set by a few)Tj
T*(national Jewish agencies, mainly for fundraising purposes, is a key cause of)Tj
T*(Jewish anxiety.  Fingers point most often at the ADL and the Los Angeles-based)Tj
T*(Simon Wiesenthal Center, both of which specialize in mass mailings warning of)Tj
T*(impending doom and urging donations." A critique of alarmist tactics was)Tj
T*(circulated by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 1993. Debra Nussbaum Cohen, a)Tj
T*(prominent Jewish journalist, noted)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("The reality, experts say, is that Jews no longer face serious discrimination in)Tj
T*(American society -- not in the community, the workplace, politics or academia.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But American Jews are convinced more than ever that antiSemitism remains a)Tj
T*(serious threat, although few have encountered any real bias themselves.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This dilemma, Ms. Cohen, avers, is occasioned by the very organizations that)Tj
T*(promote awareness of anti-Semitism and solicit funds to combat it. With apparent)Tj

T*(mainstream Jewish organization,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("By focusing on small and dramatic expressions of antiSemitism which don't mean)Tj
T*(much, they're sending an alarmist message which is, at bottom, irresponsible.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL's obsession with minuscule American hate groups has been noticed abroad)Tj
T*(as well. In October 1991 the Jerusalem Post editorialized)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("Disappointingly, the Anti-Defamation League, which used to take firm positions)Tj
T*(on Israel and devote much effort to its causes, now wastes energy on such)Tj

T*(S. administration and the media.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In a perceptive analysis of the hate crime controversy appearing in Reason)Tj
T*(magazine, associate editor Jacob Sullum observed that serious problems exist in)Tj
T*(ADL statistics.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("...a single random event can skew the numbers, falsely suggesting an alarming)Tj
T*(nationwide rise. For example, the ADL counted twice as many anti-Semitic)Tj
T*(assaults in 1991 as it did in 1990.- But all but a handful of the additional at-)Tj
T*(A tacks were associated with unrest in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, following a car)Tj
T*(accident in which a Hasidic Jew killed a black boy. If that incident hadn't)Tj
T*(happened the number of assaults would have been roughly the same.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Sullum also observes that the statistics constructed by the ADL fail to provide)Tj
T*(necessary perspective.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("In 1990, the same year the ADL counted 30 anti-Semitic assaults, the Federal)Tj
T*(Bureau of Investigation counted nearly I million arrests for assault nationwide.)Tj
T*(Jews represent about 2.4 percent of the population, and let's assume that they)Tj
T*(suffer a proportionate number of assaults. That means that for every assault)Tj
T*(motivated by anti-Semitism, Jews experience roughly QQQ assaults for other)Tj
T*(reasons \(assuming that every assault led to an arrest\)." 3)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Faced with growing criticism of its statistics from within the Jewish community)Tj
T*(and without, the ADL commissioned another study to support its agenda.)Tj
T*(Amazingly, the May 1992 ADL study reported that "One in five adult Americans)Tj

T*(prevalent among blacks and the elderly, according to a survey released Monday.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Overall, 20 percent of Americans in the survey fell into the 'most anti-Semitic')Tj
T*(category. Thirty-seven percent of blacks were in the category, compared with 17)Tj
T*(percent of whites." 4)Tj

T*(sticking together more than other Americans was "a quality that could regarded)Tj
T*(as ambiguous, if not positive, by non-Jews and Jews alike." Other questions,)Tj
T*(such as the one implying Jewish leadership ability, are equally troublesome.)Tj
T*(.This could easily be taken as a compliment. By injecting these two ambiguous)Tj
T*(questions in the survey the ADL survey seriously fudged the results. A more)Tj
T*(interesting result might have been obtained if the same questions were posed to)Tj
T*(an equal number of Jews.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Another critical account of the ADL survey was penned by Richard Cohen in the)Tj
T*(Washington Post Magazine. He observed)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("You may even want to publicly agree with one of the statements with which the)Tj
T*(surveyors caught anti-Semites in the process of thinking anti-Semitically: 'Jews)Tj
T*(pretty much run the movie and television industries.' I would have said yes to)Tj
T*(that myself.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cohen adds that he could cite several books to back up this position, and that)Tj
T*(Hollywood has been dominated by Jews so completely and their influence in the)Tj
T*(entertainment business is so vast that to name them would take up the remainder)Tj
T*(of his column. In short, to agree to this statement is simply not evidence of)Tj
T*(anti-Semitism.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(However Cohen admonishes that)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("...non-Jews know better than to comment about what is before their very eyes.)Tj
T*(Should they answer forthrightly, they might well be denounced for)Tj
T*(anti-Semitism.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A very good point. In fact, in the ADL survey, they were. What many critics have)Tj
T*(pointed out as a perverse and manipulative double standard in perceptions of)Tj

T*(Hate Crime In Perspective)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL statistics have their problems, and similar compilations of)Tj
T*("hate-motivated" incidents compiled by other interested parties, such as the)Tj
T*(NAACP and Klanwatch are also flawed. Perhaps the most glaring flaw in these)Tj
T*(statistics is the practice of counting unsolved incidents. Doubtless, numerous)Tj
T*(hoaxes are included among them.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Other crime statistics help to put these figures in perspective. For example,)Tj
T*(570 individuals -- mostly young minority males -- died in violent, often)Tj
T*(interracial, gang warfare in Los Angeles in the twelve months of 1989. In)Tj
T*(addition there were 3,819 gang-related reported assaults with deadly weapons, 93)Tj
T*(rapes and 1,851 robberies. The perpetrators of this year of carnage, which)Tj
T*(certainly surpasses the death toll from racist and anti-Semitic "hate crimes" in)Tj
T*(20th century America, have also been mostly young minority males, primarily)Tj

T*(The issue of black gang violence was graphically illustrated by a thirty second)Tj

T*(in 1992. The commercial began with a shot of a Ku Klux Klansman on the left and)Tj

T*(ample ammunition for both criminal prosecutions and private lawsuits. Such was)Tj
T*(the case in San Francisco.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The evidence that developed against the ADL was overwhelming. Not only did their)Tj

T*(numerous other infractions as well. There was active speculation that felony)Tj
T*(indictments against prominent ADL officials would be forthcoming. They were not.)Tj

T*("Some close observers believe that political pressure will make it impossible to)Tj

T*(Hate Groups in America)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In 1980 the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights contracted with the AntiDefamation)Tj
T*(League to produce a report on extreme right "hate groups" for a $20,000 fee. The)Tj
T*(ADL hardly needed the fee, but was thrilled at having the implied endorsement of)Tj

T*(it on several grounds. A letter dated March 8, I982, from Paul Alexander, acting)Tj
T*(general counsel of the commission, to John Hope, III, acting staff director,)Tj
T*(gave the following reasons,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("I would like to raise several policy considerations. The ADL report does not in)Tj

T*(contains many inaccuracies. It is doubtful that the report could survive the)Tj
T*(normal process of a source-check as their does not appear to be sufficient date)Tj
T*(to support the allegations.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Alexander further noted that the ADL report "bordered on jingoism."r Although)Tj
T*(the USCCR wisely declined to lend its name to the report, the ADL published it)Tj
T*(anyway, with epithets, emotionally laden labels, and jingoism" intact. Like all)Tj
T*(ADL publications on the people and groups that it hates, its tone is one that)Tj
T*(encourages contempt for the civil liberties of its subjects and treats them in a)Tj

T*(the membership list and the mailing list are usually two distinct entities. Ku)Tj
T*(Klux Klan organizations have maintained large complimentary mailing lists in the)Tj
T*(past, although that practice has faded for reasons of economy. Some groups don't)Tj
T*(have "members" as such, only people who receive their mailings, and others make)Tj
T*(no distinction between members and people who write and ask for information. A)Tj
T*(few groups even send out blank membership cards with their solicitation letters.)Tj
T*(According to the ADL, in 1990, the various Ku Klux Klan organizations had a)Tj
T*(combined membership under 4,000, down from 45,000 in 1964 and 12,500 in 1981. In)Tj
T*(1987, during a period  g growth, the ADL estimated hard-core neo-Nazis at "no)Tj
T*(more than 400-500." The much publicized "skinheads", recently estimated at 5,000)Tj
T*(nationwide are almost certainly no more than a third of that. Determining who is)Tj
T*(and who isn't a neo-Nazi racist skinhead involves a lot of pure guessing. A)Tj
T*(recent possible hoax in Denver initially focused on the local skinhead)Tj
T*(population and an estimate of 200 was made, a great surprise to bona fide Denver)Tj
T*(racist groups. Many bikers adopt the skinhead appearance while having no serious)Tj
T*(affinity for their views, and there are many "anti-racist" skinhead groups)Tj
T*(around. The actual number of bona fide racist, neo-Nazi skinheads in Denver is)Tj
T*(probably under 25. At the time a Kansas City KKK "group" made national news in)Tj
T*(1988 with its plans for a public TV show it had only two members. Speculation)Tj
T*(had ranged as high as a hundred and rumors of alleged KKK vandalism and)Tj
T*(cross-burnings spread through the community.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Groups like the "Posse Comitatus" attained almost mythical proportions in the)Tj
T*(early 1980s, with estimates as high as 40,000 given by irresponsible writers.)Tj
T*(This was absolute fantasy, although Jim Wickstrom, Posse "leader," claimed the)Tj
T*(incredible figure of a million and a half! Having talked with police agencies,)Tj
T*(journalists, farmers and local officials, and with Posse members themselves, I)Tj
T*(seriously doubt if more than 1,000 serious Posse activists ever existed at any)Tj
T*(one time. The Posse was never tightly organized and the national "group" was)Tj
T*(primarily a literature distribution operation. Local "groups" were autonomous)Tj
T*(and virtually anyone could claim membership and be believed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In Kansas, for example, State police officials monitoring farm auctions in the)Tj
T*(early 1980s made the incredible mistake of estimating Posse presence in one case)Tj
T*(by noting that a "Posse" activist was present and he had thirty or so people)Tj
T*(gathered around him reading the literature he passed out hence, there was a Posse)Tj
T*("presence" in the "neighborhood of thirty" at the auction! A single individual)Tj
T*(distributing Posse literature in service stations and restaurant restrooms)Tj
T*(caused near panic in one county.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This situation got so far out of hand that in 1985 three Kansans filed a civil)Tj
T*(rights lawsuit against Kansas Attorney General Robert Stephen for "creating" the)Tj
T*(Posse Comitatus to further his political career. A suit brought on behalf of)Tj
T*(Freda Steele, James Steele and Harold Hollander, all 4 rural Kansas residents,)Tj
T*(charged that unnecessary police powers were utilized during a repossession)Tj
T*(action against Mr. Steele, which included "air support and a small army of)Tj

T*(filed civil suit on behalf of victim's family. None of the skinheads was worth)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The Metzgers and WAR had minimal assets, not nearly enough to even cover the)Tj

T*(standard was illustrated in the 1990 "dart man" case in New York City. "Dart)Tj
T*(man" was a black man who went around Manhattan shooting blowgun darts into)Tj
T*(women's behinds. Although all of "dart man's" two dozen plus victims were white)Tj
T*(\(including two light-skinned hispanics\), it was reported that "authorities do)Tj
T*(not think race is a factor.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Police are quoted as saying that they "have no reason to believe the attacks are)Tj
T*(racially motivated." However, in New York City's diverse racial mix the odds of)Tj
T*(picking two dozen white women at random are on the order of winning Lotto)Tj
T*(America! Imagine for a moment what the conclusion would have been had "dart man")Tj

T*(they reach the wire services. I've also been told that a fair number are simply)Tj

T*(as a "hate crime," along with the interesting fact that the perpetrator hag)Tj

T*(Valid Objections To Hate Crimes Reporting Act)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There are many valid criticisms of the "hate crime reporting" concept but by far)Tj
T*(the most legitimate is that selective reporting exaggerates a phenomenon by)Tj
T*(calling selective attention to it. If statistics were kept of crimes committed)Tj
T*(by Methodists, or left-handed Democrats, or by service station employees, or of)Tj
T*(crimes against these groups, it would quickly seem that we have a serious crime)Tj
T*(problem in these areas. To answer an objection to this argument from a Jewish)Tj
T*(friend, I asked what the probable consequences of compiling and publicizing)Tj
T*(statistics on crimes by Jews in the United States might be, so as to draw)Tj
T*(attention to them. He quickly conceded that it would seriously distort the)Tj
T*(picture and lead to "dangerous false conclusions" by "singling out a particular)Tj
T*(group" and would be "unfair selective attention." Enough said. A s)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Civil libertarians are traditionally concerned with two issues more than any)Tj
T*(other. In criminal law, they are concerned with due process issues, i.e., the)Tj
T*(fairness of the criminal justice system and its adherence to procedural)Tj
T*(processes that ensure even-handedness and protection for the rights of the)Tj
T*(accused. In constitutional law, the issue of free speech overshadows most other)Tj
T*(concerns, since it is regarded as the bedrock upon which all other freedoms)Tj
T*(depend, and rightly so.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Anti-Defamation League seems acutely aware that too scrupulous an adherence)Tj
T*(to civil liberties can be counter-productive to its interests. For example,)Tj
T*(inconvenient standards of evidence in criminal trials may allow individuals they)Tj
T*(would prefer to see convicted to go without punishment and ritual defamation,)Tj
T*(hence their clever advocacy of civil action against individuals and groups who)Tj
T*(offend their interests, whether or not they have been convicted of an actual)Tj
T*(criminal offense. In civil cases, evidence is allowable that wouldn't get past)Tj
T*(the door in a criminal case. Among other things, the standard for conviction is)Tj
T*(merely the preponderance of evidence, and not the more rigorous "beyond any)Tj
T*(reasonable doubt." Simply put, if you can't prove a crime, you may still be able)Tj
T*(to punish with a civil judgment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Similarly, although they routinely deny it, free speech is troublesome to the)Tj
T*(ADL when it includes values, opinions and beliefs they they regard as retrograde)Tj
T*(to their interests, such as criticism of Jews, Israel, or Jewish institutions.)Tj
T*(When the ADL condemns anti-Semitism, they are usually condemning some form of)Tj
T*(expression of values, opinions and beliefs. Accordingly, while the ADL has)Tj
T*(officially given muted opposition to discredited and unconstitutional "hate)Tj
T*(speech" legislation, it has worked mightily to create the climate that produced)Tj
T*(it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The "hate speech" case in question was a St. Paul, Minnesota, ordinance)Tj
T*(outlawing mere expressions of racism and anti-Semitism, including speech,)Tj
T*(writing, art as well as symbolic acts such as cross burnings The United States)Tj
T*(Supreme Court decided unanimously in June, 1992, that the ordinance was in)Tj
T*(violation of the constitution.)Tj

T*(On the other hand, the issue in the ADL's model "hate crime" statute, which they)Tj
T*(have successfully lobbied through most state legislatures, and which is being)Tj
T*(embodied in federal legislation as well, is that certain forms of speech, such)Tj
T*(as hostility or contempt for racial or ethnic interest groups, may not be)Tj
T*(unlawful in itself, but when expressed in conjunction with a criminal act, such)Tj
T*(as graffiti, vandalism or assault, it should result in a mandatory increase in)Tj
T*(sentence.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Bona fide criminal activity, including violence, is always prosecutable, as it)Tj
T*(should be, but the ADL clearly feels that criminal activity directed against)Tj
T*(Jews and their clients in the minority community deserves special punishment.)Tj
T*(However, to make a law singling out a particular interest group for special)Tj
T*(protection is a touchy subject, and consistent civil libertarians have tended to)Tj
T*(oppose that tactic, affirmative action programs aside. The ADL anticipated that)Tj
T*(laws prohibiting acts directed at specific groups as "hate crimes" might present)Tj
T*(constitutional difficulties \(particularly the equal protection clause\). Such)Tj
T*(laws may also encourage public perception that "special people get special)Tj
T*(protections," a view that the ADL wishes to discourage. Americans tend to reject)Tj
T*("group rights," and public awareness that the ADL is promoting precisely what)Tj
T*(could be a public relations blunder.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ADL chose to minimize these complications by focusing its legislative)Tj
T*(offensive on the sentencing phase of the criminal procedure. This way, one can)Tj
T*(say that the accused has not been convicted of a "special" crime designed to)Tj
T*(provide "special protections" to "special groups," but rather has been convicted)Tj
T*(of an ordinary crime -- only the punishment is to be more severe because of the)Tj
T*(circumstances surrounding it. No one is being convicted of a thought crime)Tj
T*(because of their values, opinions and beliefs, only A S sentenced to longer)Tj
T*(terms because of them. But why this convoluted tactic?  Wouldn't the appellate)Tj
T*(courts see the ruse? In 1993 the Wisconsin Supreme Court did exactly that when)Tj
T*(they it invalidated a state law mandating longer sentences in hate crimes. Many)Tj
T*(civil libertarians applauded this development. Sentencing practices are the)Tj
T*(neglected area of due process. One can see this immediately by noting the wide)Tj
T*(disparity of sentencing in similar crimes. A simple $100 burglary may bring)Tj
T*(probation in one case, and 20 years in another.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Factors only marginally relevant to the seriousness of the crime at hand are)Tj
T*(allowed in the sentencing process, such as the defendant's appearance or)Tj
T*(courtroom demeanor, the judge's perception of the defendant's repentance \(which)Tj
T*(may say as much about the judge as it does the defendant\), or whether or not the)Tj
T*(defendant plead guilty or had the temerity to demand a trial. In other words,)Tj
T*("evidence" can be entered into a sentencing hearing that would be inadmissible)Tj
T*(in the trial itself. More than one civil liberties attorney has cringed at the)Tj
T*(arbitrariness of sentencing procedures. It could be said with respect to hate)Tj
T*(crimes that all the penalty enhancement statutes do is formalize a kind of)Tj
T*(discrimination that is already occurring on an ad hoc basis. Unfortunately,)Tj
T*(penalty enhancement makes it mandatory.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Racial Motivation and Sentencing Policy)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The particular case that brought this issue before the U. S. Supreme Court in)Tj
T*(1993 involved not a white, but a black defendant in a case of aggravated)Tj
T*(battery. Todd Mitchell was one of a group of black teen-agers who severely beat)Tj
T*(a 14-year old white boy in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 1989. The group had just seen)Tj
T*(the film Mississippi Burning, which glorifies the civil rights movement of the)Tj
T*(1960s and vilifies its opposition -- not a particularly difficult task. When)Tj

T*(that followed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A jury found Mitchell guilty, and he was sentenced to two years in prison, the)Tj
T*(maximum for aggravated battery in Wisconsin. However, the jury, finding that)Tj
T*(Mitchell chose his victim on the basis of his race, went on to increase his)Tj
T*(sentence to a maximum seven years, or a 350% increase! Paradoxically, had)Tj
T*(Mitchell merely beaten a black person for some other reason, such as wanting his)Tj
T*(shoes, he would not have been so thoroughly savaged at sentencing. Two years)Tj
T*(would be two years, and he probably wouldn't have gotten that.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mitchell appealed, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court invalidated the longer)Tj
T*(sentence. They said the state legislature had violated the First Amendment by)Tj
T*(criminalizing "bigoted thought with which it disagrees." Civil rights groups and)Tj
T*(the ADL were outraged. In April, 1993, Wisconsin Attorney General James E. Doyle)Tj
T*(argued the case before the U. S. Supreme Court, making the distinction that the)Tj
T*(case involved conduct and not ideas. As the result of a massive lobbying effort)Tj
T*(in which the ADL played a major part, 49 other states had filed briefs in)Tj
T*(support of Attorney General Doyle. The Supreme Court agreed7with Doyle, and)Tj
T*(unanimously reaffirmed Mitchell's 350% sentence enhancement.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Supreme Court's reasoning bears special examination. Chief Justice William)Tj
T*(Rehnquist, writing for the court, said that "...a defendant's abstract beliefs,)Tj
T*(however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into consideration by a)Tj
T*(sentencing judge.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Rehnquist offered that those beliefs are no longer abstract once they 1 provide)Tj
T*(the motive for discriminatory action. Thus, according to his reasoning, "a)Tj
T*(physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive conduct)Tj
T*(protected by the First Amendment." Of course it isn't, and no one argued that it)Tj
T*(was. Physical assaults are and always have been punishable. The court's decision)Tj
T*(is, of course, a can of worms. with this logic it would be possible to legislate)Tj
T*(penalty enhancement for thieves whose crimes , were motivated by "disrespect for)Tj
T*(private property," or shoplifters whose pilferage was occasioned by adherence to)Tj
T*(social doctrines that denigrate the virtue of capitalism. Although one might)Tj
T*(only be convicted of one offense, I the net effect may be to get the equivalent)Tj
T*(of two times the normal sentence. It might as well be double jeopardy, for all)Tj
T*(practical purposes, accompanied by two convictions and two sentences.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(However, all may not be not lost. If these laws are applied equally to all)Tj
T*(interracial "hate" crimes, broadly defined, and not primarily in the cases where)Tj
T*(minorities are the alleged victims, the discriminatory effect against whites may)Tj
T*(be blunted, perhaps severely. In the end they may become another nuisance law)Tj
T*(that has proven embarrassing to its proponents by virtue of its unforeseen)Tj
T*(consequences.)Tj

T*(Unforeseen Consequences of Hate Crime Legislation)Tj

T*(New York University law professor James B. Jacobs has written that the bl crime)Tj

T*(proliferation of "hate crimes" laws have resulted in \(apparently\) unforeseen)Tj

T*(How common are hate crime hoaxes? Some civil rights, Jewish and "antiracist")Tj
T*(groups stress the view that they are unusual and represent the misguided work of)Tj
T*(disturbed individuals. On the other end of the spectrum is the view held by)Tj

T*(most people are deeply effected by the emotional impact of the message. Few ask)Tj
T*(whether the message is actually true.)Tj

T*(Roots: A Search For Black Origins)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(As an example, perhaps one of the greatest literary hoaxes, with strong racial)Tj
T*(overtones, was committed by Alex Haley, author of the spurious book, Roots ,)Tj
T*(which fraudulently purports to trace his ancestry back to a village in Africa.)Tj
T*(What is particularly troublesome about this hoax is that, al- A though)Tj
T*(knowledgeable researchers doubted Haley's work from the beginning, it wasn't)Tj
T*(until December, 1978 when Haley settled a plagiarism lawsuit with Harold)Tj
T*(Courlander, author of the 1967 novel, The African, for $650,000, that it became)Tj
T*(clear how seriously Haley had fudged his facts. In the meantime, the book sold)Tj
T*(1.5 million copies and Alex Haley had won a Pulitzer Prize.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Ironically, Haley was quoted on 10 April 1977 in the New York Times,,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("It would be a scoop to beat all hell if Roots could be proved to be a hoax, and)Tj
T*(that's one of the reasons why it was so important to me to document as best I)Tj
T*(could.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Roots hoax had enormous consequences, for the story it fabricated was used)Tj
T*(to inspire militancy in a generation of black people, and was a significant)Tj
T*(factor in the development of black political power in the post-civil rights)Tj
T*(movement 1970's and 1980's. Its influence persists to this day. Although the)Tj
T*(hoax has received considerable publicity, it's still widely regarded as an)Tj
T*(authentic and inspirational legend, not uncommonly shown in the nation's schools)Tj
T*(in order to sensitize white students to the black experience. The television)Tj
T*(miniseries it generated was viewed by an estimated 130 million people and broke)Tj
T*(existing Neilsen TV ratings.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Subsequent research showed that Haley stole passages from other books and)Tj
T*(fabricated many of the characters. Even his pre-civil war U.S. research, where)Tj
T*(some records were available, was faked. when University of Alabama Professor)Tj
T*(Gary Mills and his wife, Elizabeth, editor of the National Geographic Society)Tj
T*(Quarterly, attempted to document Haley's genealogical work, they concluded)Tj

T*(The Liberators: Black-Jewish Reconciliation)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A more recent example of a hoax involving faked black history is the 1992 Public)Tj
T*(Broadcasting System film, The Liberators, which purports to tell of the part)Tj
T*(played by the all-black 761st Tank Battalion in the liberation of the Dachau)Tj
T*(concentration camp in April, 1945. Viewed by an audience of 3.7 million people,)Tj
T*(the film was nominated for an Academy Award. Largely the work of William Miles)Tj
T*(and Nina Rosenblum, producers of politically-correct documentaries on blacks and)Tj
T*(women, the film was designed to ease strained black-Jewish relations. Leaders)Tj
T*(from the black and Jewish communities viewed a special showing of the film and)Tj
T*(spoke of a "common history of oppression." Good sentiments aside, they had)Tj
T*(chosen a fraudulent vehicle to bring the groups closer.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In a February 1992 interview in The New Republic, Nina Rosenblum attacked)Tj
T*(critics of the film as "Holocaust revisionists," and attributed their criticism)Tj
T*(to racism. But according to former Army Captain David Williams of the 761st, the)Tj
T*(unit was nowhere near Dachau when the camp was liberated. He says,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("On April 29, 1945, the 761st was near Straubing, which is 30 about 70 miles)Tj
T*(from Dachau as the crow flies. Bridges were down, the tanks were all beat up.,)Tj
T*(There wasn't enough gas. Nobody could have just taken a Sherman tank on a)Tj

T*(court-martialed.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Philip Latimer, president of the 761st veteran's group, said, "all anybody had)Tj
T*(to go is look at our history. There is no mention of Dachau or Buchenwald.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Other doubts about the documentary arose and articles questioning its veracity)Tj
T*(appeared elsewhere. Finally, in February, 1993, WNET-TV, a PBS affiliate)Tj
T*(involved in the film's production, decided to withdraw The Liberators from)Tj

T*(system. According to the hoax, Dr. Drew bled to death following a 1950)Tj

T*(Dr. Martin Luther King: A Case of Plagiarism)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There has been no greater black icon than Martin Luther King, whose name became)Tj
T*(synonymous with the civil rights movement in America. Yet, controversy plagued)Tj
T*(his life until his terrible assassination in 1968. It became widely known that)Tj
T*(he was abusive to women and frequented prostitutes as he traveled around the)Tj
T*(country. Several of his close associates had long-time ties to the Communist)Tj
T*(party. What was not known until long after his death, however, was that his)Tj
T*(degree as "Dr." was unearned and, in fact, the product of fraud.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(King's degree was awarded for a supposedly original thesis entitled "A)Tj
T*(Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry)Tj
T*(Nelson Wireman" he submitted to Boston University in 1955 as part of his)Tj
T*(requirements for a phd. Over the years rumors built up about the originality of)Tj
T*(the work, and in 1990 the University established a committee to investigate the)Tj
T*(alleged plagiarism. In October 1991, the committee released its findings.   ')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I "There is no question but that Dr. King plagiarized in the dissertation by)Tj
T*(appropriating material from sources not explicitly credited in notes, or)Tj
T*(mistakenly credited, or credited generally and at some distance in the text from)Tj
T*(a close paraphrase or verbatim quotation.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In spite of these highly damaging findings, however, the committee said that "no)Tj
T*(thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King's doctoral degree from)Tj
T*(Boston University." 5)Tj

T*(professor of Social Ethics\), said "I think it is good to get this behind us.")Tj

T*(The Absence of Healthy Skepticism)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Most Americans take a surprisingly uncritical and unquestioning attitude toward)Tj
T*(this problem.i They seem to believe that whatever is said, or written, or done)Tj
T*(in the service of a good cause must be the truth - particularly if that cause is)Tj
T*(fighting racism and anti-Semitism. Why, after all, would anyone lie, fabricate,)Tj
T*(exaggerate or distort when it seems clear that they are pure in heart? And what)Tj
T*(if they did?i Aren't they doing it for a good cause? And what of those who)Tj
T*(expose these deceptions? Isn't this evidence of some kind of covert racism or)Tj
T*(anti-Semitism? Why would anyone talk bad about a good cause? In short, those who)Tj
T*(lie and distort are the good guys, and those who pursue the facts of the matter)Tj
T*(are the bad guys! This is a pretty incredible situation, indeed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(For example, the elaborate rape hoax concocted by Tawana Brawley, her mother and)Tj
T*(Rev. Al Sharpton was accepted at face value by politicians and the media.  It)Tj
T*(brought about a virtual orgy of white guilt and anti-racist agitation, and we)Tj
T*(were made to feel that in some metaphysical way we were all somehow responsible)Tj
T*(for what happened to this young black girl. Finally, an intensive investigation)Tj
T*(revealed the hoax that should have been suspected early on.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There are still people who believe that the story "must have something to it.")Tj
T*(You even heard the argument that "if it didn't happen to her, it might have)Tj
T*(happened to someone else somewhere, sometime." It became a question of the)Tj
T*(identity of the victim and alleged victimizers, and not one of facts or)Tj
T*(evidence. For many people, that Tawana Brawley was black was all they needed to)Tj
T*(know. Nothing else carried as much significance as her minority status.)Tj

T*(Victimhood Pays)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In terms of cost-benefit analysis, the actual payoff for victimhood can be very)Tj
T*(high and the risk of discovery of a hoax very small. This issue of "secondary)Tj
T*(gain" plays an important part in racist and anti-Semitic hoaxes, and the search)Tj
T*(for an answer to this troubling phenomenon is well served by the question, "Who)Tj
T*(benefits?")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When a hoaxer gets caught, which isn't often, there are "fall back" positions)Tj
T*(which can put a positive spin on the incident. The hoaxer's status may be)Tj
T*(reframed so that "blaming the victim" can be alleged. Or, he may become)Tj
T*("mentally ill," which also removes any responsibility for the hoax. Barry Dov)Tj
T*(Schuss, responsible for several apparently anti-Semitic arsons,, wanted to keep)Tj
T*(awareness of anti-Semitism alive and, until he was caught, accomplished it)Tj
T*(through a series of arsons in Hartford's Jewish community. 17)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Psychiatric treatment was the major part of his "punishment". The rest was)Tj
T*(probation and a suspended sentence. 1 In the case of Sabrina Collins, who)Tj
T*(fabricated harassment and death threats, the county prosecutor said she needed)Tj
T*("counseling and treatment, not prosecution" for her hoax. I did not uncover a)Tj
T*(case where a white, non-minority defendant in a "hate crime" prosecution was)Tj
T*(treated so generously or relieved of responsibility in such a manner.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(With hoaxes the nature of the offense makes discovery difficult. Telephone)Tj
T*(harassment, for example, usually leaves no forensic evidence, unless the problem)Tj
T*(is severe enough for police to order a monitoring device. This happened in)Tj
T*(several of the hoaxes mentioned in this essay. A telephone message service by)Tj
T*(the Oklahoma White Man's Association was being sabotaged by endless incoming)Tj
T*(calls tying up the line. The group complained to the police and the telephone)Tj
T*(company who installed tracing equipment on the line., An investigation showed)Tj
T*(that the local Jewish Community Center where a computer was apparently)Tj
T*(automatically dialing call after call, was the source of the problem. In spite)Tj
T*(of hard evidence to the contrary, Jewish Community Center director David)Tj
T*(Bernstein said, "We have no computers here and we're not jamming any phones." No)Tj
T*(criminal charges were filed. In other cases, Buzz Cody and Laurie Recht, both of)Tj
T*(whom fabricated anti-Semitic death threats, were entrapped with telephone)Tj
T*(tracing equipment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In the case of defacing property with racist and anti-Semitic graffiti,)Tj
T*(investigation is made only slightly easier. Spray painted graffiti, unlike)Tj
T*(handwriting or typewritten material, cannot be pinned down- gin two cases S)Tj
T*(mentioned in this study the discovery of the very spraycan in the possession of)Tj
T*(the "victims" led to their prosecution, but both were acquitted on the basis of)Tj
T*(insufficient evidence.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The eye-witness account is often an important factor in hoax investigation. In)Tj
T*(many cases it was this that led authorities to suspect fabrication. The factor)Tj
T*(here was inconsistent testimony or different stories by different witnesses, or)Tj
T*(physical evidence of lying. Where the possibility of a hoax exists, the witness)Tj
T*(\(who is often the victim\) should be interrogated by a person skilled in that)Tj
T*(area. Surprisingly, the cover story often isn't very well prepared and can be)Tj
T*("cracked" with reasonable effort. In the case of Quentin Banks, who faked a)Tj

T*(Because bona fide organized racist and anti-Semitic incidents are relatively)Tj

T*(strong. Victims are usually treated as heroes who have been ennobled by their)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The personal benefits are impressive as well. Many hoaxers have received)Tj
T*(substantial assistance from sympathizers and wellwishers, as in the case of)Tj
T*(Patricia Anderson and Lee Williams, who vandalized their own house, and received)Tj
T*(offers of clothing, gifts and money. Laurie Recht, who faked death threats and)Tj
T*(graffiti, became a celebrity for her victimhood, and wound up with a scholarship)Tj
T*(and an honorary "Doctor of Humane Letters" before her hoax was discovered. The)Tj
T*(most important benefits of victimization are psychological, however.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The delicious sense of importance and meaning to one's life that victimization)Tj
T*(brings is often overlooked as a motive in hoaxes of the kind illustrated here. I)Tj
T*(suspect it plays a very significant role. The paranoid personality, with it's)Tj
T*(tendency to interpret everyday experience in vigilant and suspicious terms,)Tj
T*(revels in the attention of recognized victimization. Victimization gives dignity)Tj
T*(to the undignified, importance to the unimportant, and a kind of "I told you so")Tj
T*(self-fulfilling prophecy that explains failure and disappointment as few things)Tj
T*(can. Not being liked becomes less of as question of what is wrong with you than)Tj
T*(what is wrong with others who don't like you.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Some people become important and valued for what they do, their contributions to)Tj
T*(their loved ones, to their careers, and to society; others for what is done to)Tj
T*(them. In the former case many years of forming character traits and a reputation)Tj
T*(are required, and the resulting importance can be seen as a reward for)Tj
T*(recognized accomplishment. In the latter case no such accomplishment is)Tj
T*(required, only that one is victimized. Victimization is instant fame, instant)Tj
T*(sympathy, and often in some form or another, instant compensation. Whatever)Tj
T*(shortcomings, unpopularity or character flaws one has are eclipsed by the)Tj
T*(wickedness of one's alleged persecutors. Having the "right" enemies can often)Tj

T*(On The Campus)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The college and university campus, because of its young and imaginative)Tj
T*(population, and also because of the immense pressure for "political)Tj
T*(correctness," is a hotbed of sensitivity and awareness of ethnicity and race. It)Tj
T*(is not surprising that a large number of hoaxes and pranks occur there,)Tj
T*(including some of the more imaginative cases. It's also on the campus that most)Tj
T*(of the unreported hoaxes occur, i.e., they are discovered to be hoaxes early)Tj
T*(enough that they simply are never reported in the campus or community press.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cases)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Quentin E. Banks, a black student at Northwest Missouri University in Maryville,)Tj
T*(reported a "racially motivated" assault and death threats against himself to)Tj
T*(university officials in October 1988. Following extensive media attention,)Tj
T*(rumors of a Ku Klux Klavern among NMU students emerged and the campus shifted)Tj
T*(into a crisis atmosphere. Even the President of NMU, Dean Hubbard, bought the)Tj
T*(story, saying:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("We believe the klavern is made up of about five students, who are distributing)Tj
T*(the leaflets and letters on the students' cars and under their doors. The U. S.)Tj
T*(Marshall's office and the FBI have told us that this is a violation of the)Tj
T*(students' civil rights. We'll catch one of 'em these days at it." 1)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At a campus rally some two hundred students, faculty and administrators)Tj
T*(protested that racism, instigated by the Ku Klux Klan, did not belong on the)Tj
T*(campus or in Maryville, and that it would not be tolerated.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In fact, there was no Klavern at NMU, although as many as 15 black students had)Tj
T*(reported finding Ku Klux Klan fliers on windshields and dormitory doors. James)Tj
T*(A. Moran, "Grand Dragon" of a two-man KKK "Klavern" in nearby Kansas City, took)Tj
T*(advantage of the publicity and announced that "We'll grow and prosper off their)Tj
T*(paranoia" with plans to exploit the situation. Newspaper accounts portrayed the)Tj
T*(campus as a hotbed of racism as the situation gained the national spotlight.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The case unraveled a month later when the principal "victim" came clean and)Tj
T*(confessed to having fabricated the entire story. On the strength of the original)Tj
T*(complaint by Banks, 18, the university had summoned assistance from the F.B.I.)Tj
T*(and a special unit of the Justice Department. Later, when President Hubbard)Tj
T*(began noticing inconsistencies in Banks' account of the alleged incidents, he)Tj
T*(summoned a special investigator from the Missouri Highway Patrol. During the)Tj
T*(course of an interrogation by Sgt. Larry R. Stobbs of the patrol, Banks broke)Tj
T*(down and confessed to his hoax.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(During the several-week period when Banks' story had been believed, he had been)Tj
T*(a campus hero, talked about and admired for his "victimization." 1 School)Tj
T*(officials encouraged Banks to address freshman classes on his alleged)Tj
T*(experiences. According to Hubbard, the student became "the center of much)Tj
T*(attention" following the incidents. 1)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Banks was subsequently suspended from school for two years. He claims that all)Tj
T*(he did was "devise a really big calculated plan to test university policy" on)Tj
T*(non-discrimination.)Tj

T*(throughout the campus. The fliers contained neo-Nazi icons, a border resembling)Tj
T*(a series of swastikas, a flaming sword, and three imperial eagles at the bottom.)Tj
T*(The content of the flyer was calculated to provoke the radical anti-racist and)Tj
T*(multicultural forces on the campus. It stated, in part)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("Aren't you tired of minority special interest groups being given preferential)Tj
T*(treatment on this campus.")Tj

T*(administration and the community of cultural extortionists the power of our)Tj
T*(voices. We must be heard!")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When the appointed date came the area was filled with 200 "anti-racist,")Tj
T*(feminist, gay rights and multicultural counter demonstrators, all expressing)Tj
T*(their indignation over the message on the flyer. Led by Ann Neick, chairwoman of)Tj
T*(the Lawrence Alliance and Dean of the Social Welfare department at the)Tj
T*(University, the group was apparently disappointed that no one from the)Tj
T*(Conservative Christian Crusade had decided to appear. Nevertheless, a good)Tj
T*(consciousness-raising time was had by all, including speeches condemning racism,)Tj
T*(sexism, homophobia, and so on.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In point of fact, there was no such group as the Conservative Christian Crusade.)Tj
T*(A hunt on and off the campus failed to turn up a single member, or even anyone)Tj
T*(who said they had heard of the organization prior to the fliers. The KU)Tj
T*(Department of Religious Studies was not familiar with the group. Campus police)Tj
T*(checked all local print shops and failed to find any who had printed the fliers.)Tj
T*(KU police Lt. John Mullens said, "As far as we know, there is no organization)Tj
T*(whatsoever by that name." He also said he thought the flyer was a hoax. This)Tj
T*(writer contacted the few bona fide right-wing students on the campus and none of)Tj
T*(them had heard of the group, although they acknowledged they would like to.)Tj

T*("Laird Wilcox, former KU student and founder of the Wilcox Collection of)Tj

T*(1993 to find three racial slurs written on notebook paper posted on the door of)Tj
T*(the Black Student Union building. The event took place five days before the)Tj
T*(start of Black History Month. The campus convulsed with social consciousness)Tj
T*(spasms and indignant speeches condemning racism. 7.7 percent of the students at)Tj
T*(Williams are black. The notes posted on Rice House had said "Die Niggers", 5 "Go)Tj
T*(home niggers," and "Niggers are worth less than dirt under this house.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Black Student Union covered the campus with posters deploring the act and)Tj
T*(challenging students to examine themselves for racist attitudes. Shortly)Tj
T*(afterwards, Dean Joan Edwards informed the campus, without specifying the)Tj
T*(student's race, that a student had confessed to the act. Although rumors spread)Tj
T*(on the campus, it was fully 10 days before the Williams Record, the campus)Tj
T*(newspaper, reported that Gilbert Moore, a black student, had been suspended.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Interestingly, even though Moore had informed the Black Student Union of his)Tj
T*(acts when he confessed to university authorities, the BSU continue to exploit)Tj
T*(the incident as a bona fide case of white racism until the student newspaper)Tj
T*(reported otherwise. The newspaper Bad criticized the BSU for perpetrating "an)Tj
T*(implicit lie" through silence.)Tj

T*(In February 1993 Lewis Williams, 19, a black sophomore and resident dormitory)Tj
T*(assistant at Slippery Rock University near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, returned to)Tj
T*(his room to find a racial epithet -- "Head Nigger" -- scrawled on his door with)Tj
T*(a black marker. Two other black students, James Kenney and Darryle Carpenter,)Tj
T*(also found the word "Nigger" on the door of the room they share in the same)Tj
T*(building.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When Williams reported the incidents, he opined that the slurs were related to)Tj
T*(Black History Month, currently being observed on the campus. The incident)Tj
T*(reminded students of an off-campus cross-burning three years before, in which)Tj
T*(two white students were expelled and charged with ethnic intimidation and)Tj
T*(harassment. As might be expected, the campus was electrified. Williams, a member)Tj
T*(of the Black Action Society, was quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as saying)Tj
T*(that "Racism is not something you're born with. It's something you're taught." 1)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Students didn't have to wait long for the culprit to come clean. It was Williams)Tj
T*(himself, who confessed to both incidents before campus police. Police filed)Tj
T*(criminal mischief \(a summary offense\) and ethnic intimidation charges \(a)Tj
T*(misdemeanor\) against Williams -- neither of which was likely to involve jail)Tj
T*(time.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(An attempted racist frame-up occurred at Ohio Dominican College in Columbus, in)Tj
T*(December 1988 when white student Michael A. Smith, 22, found himself under)Tj
T*(arrest for sending threatening letters to 13 black students and faculty members.)Tj
T*(The threats were worded in the same way as was a section of a term paper on)Tj
T*(prejudice he had submitted to Janice D. Hamlet, a black teacher at the school.i)Tj
T*(Hamlet had pointed out the similarities in the documents which immediately)Tj
T*(implicated Smith. The letters stated: "Death to All Niggers and Dumb Puerto)Tj
T*(Ricans." 1)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(However, two Columbus police detectives who had taken a class from Hamlet took)Tj
T*(an interest in the case. Hamlet had been outraged by Smith's use of the word)Tj
T*("nigger" in his term paper and had tried unsuccessfully to get him expelled.)Tj
T*(Forensic examination of the envelopes the threatening letters had been mailed in)Tj
T*(turned up Hamlet's fingerprints and an examination of her typewriter determined)Tj
T*(that the letters had been written on it. In fact, she had copied part of Smith's)Tj
T*(essay and mailed it to the 13 blacks and then "discovered" that they were worded)Tj
T*(in the same manner. Ethnic intimidation charges against Smith were dropped and)Tj
T*(Hamlet was charged with two felony counts of ethnic intimidation and two)Tj

T*(The unequal treatment of Smith and Hamlet raised considerable controversy on the)Tj
T*(campus. Smith was immediately suspended without a hearing after being accused of)Tj
T*(sending the fliers, while University officials appointed a "fact-finding)Tj
T*(committee" to investigate the charges against Hamlet. Also, Smith was arrested)Tj
T*(at the school and hauled off in handcuffs to a patrol car.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One would think that such a damaging fabrication would have ended Hamlet's)Tj
T*(career. At last report, however, she had returned to Kent State University to)Tj
T*(complete a phd. Michael Smith subsequently filed suit against the University for)Tj
T*($6 million and was awarded an undisclosed amount in 1990.)Tj

T*(In Atlanta, Georgia, a black freshman at Emory University claimed she had been)Tj
T*(the victim of racist attacks in her school dorm in April 1990. She had)Tj
T*(discovered the phrases "Hang Nigger" and "Die, Nigger, Die" written under a rug)Tj
T*(in her closet, as well as scrawled on her tampons in a drawer. Sabrina Collins,)Tj
T*(18, also claimed to have received two letters threatening to lynch her. In)Tj
T*(addition, bleach was poured on some of her clothes and stuffed animals, and the)Tj
T*(phrase "nigger, hang" was written on the wall of her closet. Despite an alarm)Tj
T*(that police installed in Collin's room, the incidents continued. Police)Tj
T*(eventually determined that a threatening letter had a grammatical error the)Tj
T*("victim" commonly made, that it was typed on the sort of typewriter found at her)Tj
T*(place of employment, and it had no fingerprints on it but hers. In the meantime,)Tj
T*(Collins was hospitalized and became mute. Two weeks later she was released after)Tj
T*(having recovered her speech.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The incident triggered a march by 700 students and a sit-in in front of the)Tj
T*(administration demanding a "crackdown on campus racism." Black leaders in)Tj
T*(Atlanta got into the act, perpetuating demands against hate crimes. Although it)Tj
T*(was speculated virtually from the start that Collins might be responsible for)Tj
T*(the events, considerations of "sensitivity" kept a lid on this aspect of the)Tj
T*(case for several months. Finally, police reports were leaked that confirmed)Tj
T*(suspicions.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(DeKalb County prosecutor Ralph Bowden announced that he will not pursue charges)Tj
T*(against Collins l6. He said that Collins needs "counseling and treatment, not)Tj
T*(prosecution.")Tj

T*(The Collins case is interesting in a number of respects. Otis Smith of the)Tj
T*(Atlanta chapter of the NAACP, perhaps without realizing it, admitted the utility)Tj

T*(zeroed in on a suspect He was James Oppenheim, former President of the Jewish)Tj
T*(Student Union.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(According to the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation in Washington, Jewish students)Tj
T*(represent fifty percent of the school's enrollment, one of the highest ratios at)Tj
T*(any public university in the nation. SUNY-Binghamton's president, Raymond E.)Tj
T*(Dye, responded to the accusation with the statement that Oppenheim "is entitled)Tj
T*(to full participation in all aspects of university life" and that "this should)Tj
T*(not be an occasion for prejudging a person or a group.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In September 1989, Oppenheim, 20, was arrested by state police and charged with)Tj
T*(fourth-degree criminal mischief and third-degree false reporting of a crime.)Tj
T*(These relatively minor misdemeanor offenses rarely result in jail time upon)Tj
T*(conviction.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The manner in which this case was handled is a fascinating study. State Police)Tj
T*(investigator Charles Gould, responsible for filing the charges, said of)Tj
T*(Oppenheim, "He's not a bad kid!" The Binghampton Press & Sun Bulletin quoted)Tj
T*(police investigators as saying)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("Oppenheim was trying to broaden recognition of anti-Semitism following a)Tj
T*(mediocre showing at a memorial to the victims of the Nazi Kristallnacht)Tj
T*(program.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Student Association President Craig Spiegel read a statement that warned against)Tj
T*(judging Oppenheim before due process takes its course, and reminding students)Tj
T*(that "anti-Semitism, racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of oppression)Tj
T*(existed on our campus." Three weeks later Oppenheim was elected to the Harpur)Tj
T*(College Council. Harpur is the liberal arts college at SUNY Binghamton. Rabbi)Tj
T*(Arnold Fertig described Oppenheim as an "emotional, highly-committed young man)Tj
T*(devoted to Jewish causes on the campus.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In addition to being portrayed as sincere if misguided, Oppenheim had another)Tj
T*(advantage. His father was an attorney and knew that the evidence against his son)Tj
T*(could be challenged. Aside from non-specified circumstantial evidence, the)Tj

T*(but the case was made that Oppenheim had just picked up the can and hid it so it)Tj
T*(wouldn't get lost. The Judge accepted his account and in December 1989, James)Tj
T*(Oppenheim was acquitted of all charges. In fairness, the decision for acquittal)Tj
T*(should be respected. At the time of this writing no one else had been)Tj
T*(apprehended and there were no other suspects.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Berkeley, California, police reported that there had been four attacks on white)Tj
T*(students by black students at Berkeley High School following the appearance of a)Tj
T*(racist leaflet on the campus in December 1991. The leaflet thanked blacks for)Tj
T*(killing one another in gang violence, among other things, and mimicked the)Tj
T*(stereotype of a white supremacist production.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Two days later police had located the flyer's author. He was black journalist)Tj
T*(Matthew Stelly, a reporter for the black weekly Milwaukee Courier. The flyer)Tj
T*(claimed to originate from the Ku Klux Klan.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Handed out to students at a Berkeley public transportation station, the leaflet)Tj
T*(brought an almost immediate reaction. According to Oakland Tribune reporter)Tj
T*(Robert Hollis,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("That morning, seven or eight black teenagers, who school officials said were)Tj
T*(angry over the leaflet, attacked a number of white students, four of whom were)Tj
T*(injured. Police arrested one 15-year-old sophomore after he was identified as)Tj
T*(one of the assailants.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Stelly is quoted as saying he wrote the flyer as a "reverse psychological+ cal ploy)Tj
T*(to try to get these people \(gang members\) to stop this madness.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Planned carefully, the risk of discovery of a racial hoax is minimal. However,)Tj
T*(even when a hoax is discovered it may still serve its intended purpose.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(An example of this occurred at Pennsylvania State University at State College)Tj
T*(when "an unidentified man" placed six help-wanted ads in the student newspaper)Tj
T*(asking for "colored nannies" in January 1979. The expected \(and intended\))Tj
T*(outrage resulted in several demands upon the administration: gag "About 75)Tj
T*(students met with Provost Edward D. Eddy and demanded that the school increase)Tj
T*(the number of black students, professors and programs and provide more financial)Tj
T*(aid for blacks.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The newspaper printed an apology in its help-wanted columns, but editor David)Tj
T*(Skidmore said a second apology would not be run He said the incident was being)Tj
T*(used to bring attention to a host of complaints by local black organizations.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The six phoney ads had been accepted by a junior staff member and were not)Tj
T*(approved by the newspaper's senior staff. The hoax was discovered after a search)Tj
T*(for the man who placed the ads. It was learned that the ads originally appeared)Tj
T*(in a South African newspaper and that they were placed in opposition t0 South)Tj
T*(Africa's racial policies.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Two break-ins at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Maryland, resulted)Tj
T*(in an incredible $650,000 in damages in February, 1990. Included in this figure)Tj
T*(was damage to the library, computers, storage and administration offices. In)Tj
T*(addition, gas jets were opened in the chemistry laboratory filling the school)Tj
T*(with natural gas, threatening an explosion. According to news s reports:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("The culprits, in an effort to implicate white-supremacist 'skinheads,' drew)Tj
T*(swastikas on the walls and books and left threatening, anti-Semitic messages)Tj
T*(signed by "Nazi Youth.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Investigators soon found those responsible when two students reported another)Tj
T*(student's account of the destruction.I Arrested were Jason Wesley Knight, 19,)Tj
T*(who is black, and Stephen Lawrence Bonner, 18, who is Jewish. Bonner reportedly)Tj

T*(By far the largest number of hoax incidents involve black victims and non-black)Tj

T*(The most common motive is to capitalize on the psychological benefits of)Tj

T*(Cases)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In November 1987 a black Wappingers Falls, New York, teenager, Tawana Brawley,)Tj
T*(claimed to have been kidnapped for several days, raped by white men, smeared)Tj
T*(with dog feces, placed in a plastic garbage bag and marked with racial slurs.)Tj
T*(The case quickly became a cause c√©l√®bre, with editorials, marches, and)Tj
T*(politicians and media personalities deploring the incident and the "racist)Tj
T*(climate" that obviously led to it. Rev. Al Sharpton, a black activist with a)Tj
T*(shady background, became spokesman for the Brawley family and insisted that)Tj
T*("justice be done" and the white men responsible be prosecuted. The incident)Tj
T*(fueled support for hate crime legislation around the nation as the case was)Tj
T*(reported nightly on network news.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Tawana Brawley and her handlers basked in nationwide attention and she acquired)Tj
T*(victim status on a scale rarely seen. Discrepancies in her story were evident)Tj
T*(from the very beginning. A claim that she had been raped and brutalized by three)Tj
T*(white police officers quickly fizzled out under examination. A detailed)Tj
T*(investigation determined that she was seen by friends during the period she said)Tj
T*(she was held captive and that she spent much of this time in an apartment)Tj
T*(previously rented by her family. Other elements of her story were gradually)Tj
T*(eliminated one by one and police subsequently reported that the Brawley case was)Tj
T*(a massive fabrication and hoax. what made the Brawley case outstanding was the)Tj
T*(incredible media feeding frenzy that took place. Although there was reason for)Tj
T*(skepticism virtually from the beginning, newspaper and television media were)Tj
T*(slow to pick up on the implausible nature of the allegations. Only after the)Tj
T*(doubt was substantial and clearly pointing in the direction of a hoax was the)Tj
T*(public informed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(New York Post columnist Eric Breindel commented that radical attorney William)Tj
T*(Kunstler had said, concerning the Brawley case, "It makes no difference anymore)Tj
T*(whether the attack on Tawana really happened...a lot of black woman are treated)Tj
T*(the way she says she was treated.")Tj

T*(Three years after the case broke the Brawley matter was still being litigated.)Tj

T*("A special grand jury cleared Mr. Pagones of any involvement in the Brawley case)Tj
T*(and concluded Miss Brawley fabricated the story.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(As the Brawley incident was capturing headlines in Wappingers Falls, 25 miles)Tj
T*(away in Kingston, New York, another racial hate crime hoax was brewing. Police)Tj
T*(had discovered the nude body of 19-year-old Anna Kithcart, a black woman, who)Tj
T*(had been strangled, beaten and killed. On both thighs were carved the initials)Tj
T*("KKK," an obvious reference to the Ku Klux Klan. The community was shocked and)Tj
T*(it seemed clear that malignant racism had once again struck an innocent black)Tj
T*(person.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But not for long. Within days police investigation focused on Jeffrey Allen)Tj
T*(Dawson, a 29-year-old black man with a criminal record. Dawson was arrested)Tj
T*(after he made incriminating statements about the murder to a wired undercover)Tj
T*(policeman. Kingston Police Department sources said the murder was apparently)Tj
T*(drug related. As for the alleged Ku Klux Klan connection, Ulster County District)Tj
T*(Attorney Michael Kavanagh said)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("Nothing would lead us to believe that this murder was committed by members of)Tj
T*(any racial hate group such as the Ku Klux Klan.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Interestingly, two Brawley family advisers, Rev. Al Sharpton and Alton Maddox,)Tj
T*(Jr., got on the band wagon in this case, too. Sharpton and Maddox were soon)Tj
T*(conducting their own investigation in the slaying. Said Maddox, "I believe it)Tj
T*(was a racially motivated crime.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(October 1991: two cross burnings are reported South Seattle, Washington. The)Tj
T*(first cross was 30 inches tall; the second cross never actually ignited. Aaron)Tj
T*(Briggs, one of the victims, said "It makes me mad that we have not come as far)Tj
T*(as I thought we had come." Predictably, the Ku Klux Klan- style "cross burnings")Tj
T*(sent a shock through the community. Sensitivities were raised, racism was)Tj
T*(deplored and anti-racist forces were energized. Three months later the monster)Tj
T*(was captured. Unlike most other cases, where the culprit is vilified and)Tj
T*(condemned and where no excuse whatsoever will do, this case was reported with)Tj
T*(kindness and understanding, and with a charity and compassion unusual in stories)Tj
T*(of racist criminals. Here is why:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("When they heard the confession of a troubled 16-year-old who admitted he was)Tj
T*(behind a string of cross-burnings and racial vandalism against black people in)Tj
T*(South Seattle, police were stunned and saddened. 50)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The youth, who also is black, told police he committed the acts of vandalism to)Tj
T*(create fear that would attract the media. Capt. Douglas Dills, who heads the)Tj
T*(police section that investigates malicious harassment, or hate crimes, said it)Tj
T*(appears that the youth had a fascination with both national and local media)Tj
T*(coverage of racism and racial incidents. The teenager is not only under)Tj
T*(suspicion in a string of malicious harassment cases, but in several arsons as)Tj
T*(well.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The newspaper also reported that "The youth might have been inspired by a Phil)Tj
T*(Donahue TV show the day before about hate crimes," according to police. The)Tj
T*(arrest cleared up-a large number of unsolved cases of allegedly)Tj
T*(racially-motivated crimes in the community," all registered in the statistics)Tj
T*(kept by anti-racist groups.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One of the most convoluted and bizarre hate crime hoaxes was exposed in)Tj
T*(Portland, Oregon, in October, 1992. Hoaxes can be very elaborate, and almost)Tj

T*(right lies covering up to eight years, including false claims of disability that)Tj
T*(left her wheelchair bound, and of bogus racial harassment that began as far back)Tj
T*(as 1985 when she allegedly received death threats. In 1983 Cooley moved in with)Tj
T*(Susan Soen, whom she had been dating since 1981. In 1986 she claimed she had)Tj
T*(been diagnosed with cancer and quit her job as a corrections officer. Cooley and)Tj
T*(Soen, also a corrections officer, continued to live together and were active in)Tj
T*(the community politics.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A The most recent reports of racial harassment began on May 3, 1992, when racist)Tj
T*(graffiti was painted on Cooley and Soen's house. Following that, the word)Tj
T*("Nigger" was painted on the house, a note card with "Hitler Lives, Death to All)Tj
T*(Niggers" was found on the doorstep, and a swastika with the words "burn nigger)Tj
T*(burn" was written on Cooley's wheelchair ramp. Over a period of weeks some)Tj
T*(seventeen hate crime incidents occurred, none of which police were able to)Tj
T*(solve.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cooley and Soen turned to the local Anti-Bigotry Coalition to counsel them)Tj
T*(through the ordeal. The Metropolitan Human Rights Coalition set up a special hot)Tj
T*(line to receive tips on the perpetrators. Police questioned several suspected)Tj
T*(skinheads and neo-Nazis, and even arrested one man who was seen watching the)Tj
T*(cross burn in Cooley's yard, but later said they didn't believe he was)Tj
T*(responsible.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Azalea Cooley became, to paraphrase a local journalist, a "poster child" for)Tj
T*(Portland's victimized classes, i.e., the black, handicapped and gay/lesbian)Tj
T*(communities. She reveled in her victimhood and eagerly accepted the role of a)Tj
T*(martyr. On Sunday, 1 November 1992, she helped lead a rally and march named)Tj
T*("Take A Stand Against Hate" through Portland. Photos of Cooley being pushed in)Tj
T*(her wheelchair at the head of the march were widely published. She became a)Tj
T*(symbol of the fight against bigotry and prejudice on as grand scale. On the very)Tj
T*(morning of the march, someone set fire to a cross on Cooley's lawn. Unbeknown to)Tj
T*(Cooley and Soen, however, this time police cameras recorded the incident. 51)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(That same evening police arrived and searched the Cooley-Soen residence. They)Tj
T*(said they found items in the house "consistent with materials used in the cross)Tj
T*(burning." The videotape showed that the person who lit the cross had come from)Tj
T*(inside the house. Susan Soen, who had filed the original hate crime complaints,)Tj
T*(was served with a warrant for initiating a false police report, a Class C)Tj
T*(misdemeanor. She was placed on administrative suspension at the Multnomah County)Tj
T*(Jail, where she had been a line supervisor for 15 years. No charges were filed)Tj
T*(against Cooley at that time.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Scott Lively, spokesman for the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a group opposing)Tj
T*(special civil rights protections for homosexuals known as Ballot Measure #9,)Tj
T*(made political hay of the arrest. He said)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("This vindicates our position that the No on 9 campaign has been basing their)Tj
T*(position on fraud. I think there is high emotion on both sides; but when a)Tj
T*(black, crippled woman in a wheelchair starts burning crosses in her own yard,)Tj
T*(it's fraud and a sad day for the community. I think it exposes what we have been)Tj
T*(saying all along.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On November 20, 1992, The Oregonian, a Portland daily, reported that Azalea)Tj
T*(Cooley had "confessed to staging the cross burnings, death threats and)Tj
T*(vandalism." Cooley admitted that "the hate crimes that happened at our home were)Tj
T*(my doing." In June, 1993, federal judge Helen J. Frye placed Cooley on two years)Tj
T*(probation for lying to an FBI agent. She was also ordered to spend four months)Tj
T*(in house arrest. The charges against Soen, who had filed a defamation lawsuit)Tj
T*(against sheriff's officers involved in the investigation, were still pending at)Tj

T*(Loveland, with a population of 9,900, is 97% white and 2% black, according to)Tj
T*(the 1990 census. Police and citizens initially speculated on the racial aspect)Tj
T*(of the crime. A few days later, another story began to emerge. Police had)Tj

T*(the incident was a hoax concocted by Metcalfe. Also, it was learned that the)Tj

T*(had been done in an unusually neat, careful manner. Nothing was broken and)Tj
T*(nothing was missing. Williams speculated,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("I guess there were trying to drive home a message that they don't want us in)Tj
T*(this neighborhood. We are the only blacks here.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Exactly two weeks later Williams and Anderson returned home to find their home)Tj
T*(on fire and their blue Thunderbird missing from the garage. Police reported that)Tj
T*(the fire had been deliberately set in four places. The house sustained mostly)Tj
T*(smoke damage. A careworn and dazed Williams said, "I just can't believe this.")Tj
T*(The FBI entered the case, requesting a copy of the earlier police report. Arvada)Tj
T*(Police Lt. Jeff Waller said)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("It's routine for them to look into ethnic hate crimes like this. We want to)Tj
T*(make it perfectly clear that we are not going to tolerate a situation where a)Tj
T*(family is singled out and treated this way.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Two days after the fire the Rocky Mountain News, a Denver daily, reported that)Tj
T*(Williams and Anderson had "been deluged with an outpouring of sympathy." Police)Tj
T*(Sergeant Merle Westling of the Arvada Police Department said)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("We've had calls from people wanting to donate clothing, I gifts, money to help)Tj
T*(rebuild the house - I've even been told there was a contractor over there this)Tj
T*(morning who said he'd donate some time to get the place straightened up.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Thunderbird was soon located in Denver. Police reported that someone had put)Tj
T*(a rock on the gas pedal and let it run into a parked dump truck. Police)Tj
T*(fingerprinted the car for clues. Arvada Police Chief Pat Ahlstrom said that the)Tj
T*("investigation is high priority, as is any crime with a possible racial or)Tj
T*(ethnic hatred motive.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(And investigate they did. Police learned that the family was in severe financial)Tj
T*(straits, and that the house was insured. Moreover, police were suspicious from)Tj
T*(the outset when inconsistencies developed in their account of the incidents.)Tj
T*(Within a few days Patricia Anderson was arrested, along with Lee Andrew)Tj
T*(Williams, brother of Larry Williams who was not charged in the case. Lee)Tj
T*(Williams and Anderson subsequently entered guilty pleas. In May 1991 Lee)Tj
T*(Williams was given 10 years for one count of first degree arson. Patricia)Tj
T*(Anderson received 5 years probation for attempted theft and false reporting.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In July 1990 an arson fire seriously damaged the Clothes Encounters clothing)Tj
T*(shop in Kansas City, Missouri's fashionable Westport shopping area. The owner,)Tj
T*(Angela Washington Thomas, a black woman, claimed that it was a racially)Tj

T*(because I'm black.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Thomas's claim of racial intimidation brought immense local and national media)Tj
T*(attention. Anti-racist groups were lamenting the plight of the brave young woman)Tj
T*(and calls for harsher penalties for "hate crimes" echoed throughout the)Tj
T*(community. It also brought the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the case,)Tj

T*(began to focus on him, Johnson admitted his part in the crime.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The store was failing and it was burned to collect insurance.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Thomas and Johnson were convicted. Due to an effective attorney and their)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Jews)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There can be no question that faked anti-Semitic hate crimes are a cause for)Tj
T*(grief and consternation in the Jewish community. Jewish concern with persecution)Tj
T*(is justifiable. Deep-rooted Jewish sensitivity to anti-Semitism makes hoaxes)Tj
T*(committed by Jews particularly shocking.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(These hoaxes are almost always the product of individuals seeking to achieve a)Tj
T*(sense of importance through victimhood, to advance a particular agenda, to seek)Tj
T*(monetary advantages through insurance claims or damage settlements, or perhaps)Tj
T*(more commonly, juveniles engaged in pranks.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One issue that needs to be addressed is whether or not there's an organized)Tj
T*(campaign to commit racist and anti-Semitic hoaxes. For years rumors have)Tj
T*(circulated that a particular organization has been engaged in this activity.)Tj
T*(Right-wingers are particularly fond of this notion in that it tends to confirm)Tj
T*(their conspiracy theories about the group.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It's important to avoid paranoid thinking on this issue, and to reject the kind)Tj
T*(of reasoning that suggests that every disturbing event must have a i"plot" of)Tj
T*(some kind behind it, and a series of such events must, therefore, be the product)Tj
T*(of a planned conspiracy. .Extremists on both sides of this issue tend to think)Tj
T*(in these terms with predictably unfortunate results. I found no credible)Tj
T*(evidence of a bona fide conspiracy or organized campaign to commit anti-Semitic)Tj
T*(hoaxes. The best evidence is that these hoax incidents are unconnected and the)Tj
T*(product of individuals and not of organizations.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I don't think a conspiracy is required to explain a pattern of antiSemitic)Tj
T*(hoaxes. In addition to the psychological pleasures of victimhood, the advantages)Tj
T*(of anti-Semitic incidents to Jewish activists are obvious, so much so that it)Tj
T*(would reasonably occur to potential hoaxers upon simple reflection, with no)Tj
T*(communication among them. "Who benefits" from mindless acts of anti-Semitic)Tj
T*(graffiti and vandalism is there for all to see, and it is most assuredly not)Tj
T*(anti-Semites.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Some hoaxes have involved "plots," in a manner of speaking, and several of them)Tj
T*(have involved recognizable "conspiracies" to commit the particular hoax, but)Tj
T*(linkage with other hoaxes is very unlikely, except in the limited psychological)Tj
T*(sense of the "copy-cat" phenomenon. This "copy-cat" effect is important,)Tj
T*(however, because it can account for not only bona fide racial and anti-Semitic)Tj
T*(incidents, but for additional hoaxes as well.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On the other hand, there is some evidence of a deliberate effort to cover up or)Tj
T*(minimize incidents that prove to be hoaxes, usually to avoid "giving)Tj
T*(anti-Semites ammunition," in the words of one journalist. I have encountered)Tj
T*(several cases where the news coverage of an incident was explicitly minimized)Tj
T*(once it was discovered to be a hoax. This, of course, is what is known as "spin)Tj
T*(control" and some anti-racist and "human rights" groups are pretty good at it.)Tj

T*(Swastika-painting vandals were suspected of setting fire to the basement of a)Tj
T*(downtown Denver restaurant 10 June 1990. The restaurant's Jewish owners were)Tj
T*(beside themselves with outrage at the ugly graffiti \("Hitler Reborn," "Die)Tj
T*(Jew."\). Lee Naldman, owner of the Egg Shell Restaurant, also noted that business)Tj
T*(was down 40%, according to the Rocky Mountain News: Denver police intelligence)Tj
T*(officers suspected skinhead involvement. Denver Mayor Frederico Pena ordered an)Tj
T*(investigation into recent racist acts in the city and the News carried several)Tj
T*(alarmist articles on growing racism and anti-Semitism. Lee Naldman said, "I)Tj
T*(think there's a lot more anti-Semitism in Denver than people realize." 58 City)Tj
T*(leaders responded with outrage, stepped up police activity and called for new)Tj
T*(anti-racist legislation. As the investigation proceeded, however, it became more)Tj
T*(and more apparent that skinheads were not involved in the event and the)Tj
T*(possibility of a hoax loomed on the horizon.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Denver police have heavily infiltrated local gangs and skinhead groups and had)Tj
T*(kept meticulous track of racist and anti-Semitic incidents in the a community.)Tj
T*(The News noted that most incidents were "committed by adolescents - perhaps)Tj
T*(bored and ignorant of the consequences of their acts - and not by organized hate)Tj
T*(groups...", a fact that is often ignored. A one-paragraph article finally noted)Tj
T*(that "Swastikas spraypainted on the walls of the restaurant may have been an)Tj
T*(effort to mislead." In a later article on "hate crime hoaxes," News reporter)Tj
T*(Kevin Flynn noted that)Tj

T*("After all the grandstanding and headlines, the spray painting of swastikas in)Tj
T*(the Egg Shell arson is now believed to have been a hoax, and not to have)Tj
T*(involved neo-Nazi skinheads at all. Investigators believe the swastikas were S)Tj
T*(meant to divert suspicion.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In one prominent case the suspected perpetrator of a hate crime hoax and)Tj
T*(insurance fraud was acquitted on the basis of insufficient evidence. Susan and)Tj
T*(Curtis Klein, a young Jewish couple, returned home to find .their Germantown,)Tj
T*(Maryland, townhouse vandalized. Swastikas were painted on the living room)Tj
T*(carpet, bedroom mirrors, walls and hallways. Most of their clothes were ripped)Tj
T*(and most of their furniture was either painted black, ripped, scratched or)Tj
T*(smashed. The deliberateness and effort required to commit the 22 March 1991)Tj
T*(vandalism was highly unusual in alleged hate crimes. Someone would have to have)Tj
T*(spent the better part of an hour attending to the detailed graffiti and)Tj
T*(vandalism. In the bedroom of their 8-year-old son, the words "Jew Boy" were)Tj
T*(sprayed on a mirror. According to Mr. Klein, "The officer said this is the worst)Tj
T*(case of vandalism he's ever seen in a private home." He added,)Tj

T*(that,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("...90 percent of their belongings were slashed, broken, shredded or marred with)Tj
T*(black spraypaint that was used to write hate graffiti throughout the house.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A review of hate crimes against property and anti-Semitic vandalism suggests)Tj
T*(that cases where the perpetrators go to this much effort to send a message are)Tj
T*(extremely rare. For a person to take time to shred clothes, for example, implies)Tj
T*(a deeply personal motive for the vandalism, suggesting that it might have been)Tj
T*(someone with a personal animus against the victim. Investigators could not)Tj

T*(Geehreng,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("We have not established a motive. We have no suspects. It?s strange. why was)Tj
T*(this family targeted? There were other Jewish families in the area.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Before long the media began reporting that Curtis Klein was a suspect in the)Tj
T*(case, although no charges had been filed. The Kleins' attorneys, Barry Helfand)Tj
T*(and Alan Goldstein, were accused police of "leaking information" to the press.)Tj
T*(Goldstein spoke of it in conspiratorial terms, saying the police were trying to)Tj
T*("poison the public's mind." It was also learned that Klein had been charged with)Tj
T*(stealing approximately $1,300 from a Germantown beauty salon where he used to)Tj
T*(work. On advice from his attorneys, Klein refused to answer any questions.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On July 6th, Montgomery County police charged Klein with felony theft,)Tj
T*(destruction of property and filing a false crime report in order to collect more)Tj
T*(than $31,000 from his insurance company. Anti-Defamation League regional)Tj
T*(director David Friedman, who had taken an interest in the case, expressed)Tj
T*("sadness" at the direction the case had taken. Klein denied the charges and said)Tj
T*(he had been a victim of hate violence. His wife was not charged.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A district court statement of charges detailed several inconsistencies in Kleins)Tj
T*(account.. Montgomery County detective Kevin Stone said that entry was apparently)Tj
T*(not forced. Curtis Klein reported to work as a hairdresser about 10:15 AM on the)Tj
T*(day of the incident, giving him ample time to vandalize the house. A neighbor)Tj
T*(said that the Kleins' dog, which had always barked at strangers, did not bark)Tj
T*(that morning. Although many of the Kleins' belongings were destroyed or damaged,)Tj
T*(some items that were obviously Jewish were not harmed -- somewhat the opposite)Tj
T*(of what might be expected in a bona fide hate crime.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Police immediately searched for a spraypaint can, but it was three days later)Tj
T*(that the Kleins turned in a can they said was found under the debris. The can)Tj
T*(had been purchased at the hardware store closest to the Klein residence, and a)Tj
T*(clerk said that Curtis Klein had been in the store on the morning of the)Tj
T*(vandalism. Klein at first claimed that $6,750 in jewelry had been stolen, but)Tj
T*(later said it was not missing.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The statement also said that the Kleins were in debt, including $5,000 owed to)Tj

T*(that this dog is not a very good watchdog." A week later Maryland Assistant)Tj
T*(State's Attorney James Trusty dropped the charges in the alleged theft of $1,300)Tj

T*(clothing were slashed. Drawers were strewn about, china closed and kitchen)Tj
T*(cupboard doors were opened and everything seemed to have been spotted by black)Tj
T*(spraypaint. "Jew" was painted across a table and a picture of a rabbi was)Tj
T*(slashed. Police said they found no sign of forced entry. Mrs. Klein expressed)Tj
T*(concern that police would consider her husband a suspect once again.)Tj

T*(In October, 1994, three Tacoma residents returned home to find antiSemitic)Tj
T*(slogans and swastikas, along with anti-homosexual graffiti spraypainted all over)Tj
T*(their apartment. Upholstery was slashed, plumbing torn loose, and red paint)Tj
T*(splattered throughout the interior.  Somebody had taken a long time to complete)Tj
T*(their "hate crime," which occurred while the three were attending a Gay Pride)Tj
T*(celebration in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia. Interestingly, in spite of)Tj
T*(the swastikas, none of the victims was Jewish although all three were evidently)Tj

T*(An incident which demonstrates the credulousness of both the news media and)Tj
T*(politicians whenever "anti-Semitism" is invoked occurred when World War e II)Tj
T*(veteran David Rubitsky, 71, claimed in 1988 that he had single-handedly wiped)Tj
T*(out up to 600 Japanese soldiers in the battle for New Guinea on 1 December 1942,)Tj
T*(a transparently fantastic allegation. According to Rubitsky)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("[The bodies of the Japanese soldiers] were lying there, on branches, roots,)Tj
T*(piled like cordwood atop one another. Some were still alive. Some I just hit in)Tj
T*(the shoulder and couldn't move, some in the legs. So I would just shoot them and)Tj
T*(bayonet them, shoot them and bayonet them. I was completely an insane man. To)Tj
T*(think that a human being would do that to another human being, what I did.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Rubitsky, a communications sergeant at the time, said the ordeal took some 21)Tj
T*(hours and that he used a .30 caliber heavy machine gun, a Browning automatic)Tj
T*(rifle and an M1 rifle. He also claimed that he had been denied a Congressional)Tj
T*(Medal Of Honor for his heroic feat solely because of antiSemitism. He said that)Tj
T*(Army Col. John N. Mott had told him that "Ne don't give the medal to Jews.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(According to Rubitsky, this wasn't his only brush with)Tj
T*(anti-SemitismVictimization has been a recurring theme in his life. He said his)Tj
T*(family was frequently victimized while he was growing up in Edgerton, Wisconsin:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(""Two times we had crosses burned on our lawn by a political organization," he)Tj
T*(said. My father was beaten up many, many times for no reason at all. While I was)Tj
T*(in the service, my mother was being harassed." 6)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(For several years Rubitsky diligently pursued the Medal of Honor issue, largely)Tj
T*(through a sympathetic and uncritical news media, and the assistance of the)Tj
T*(Anti-Defamation League. Due to pressure generated on Rubitsky's behalf by the)Tj
T*(ADL, including a resolution signed by 92 members of congress, the Army undertook)Tj
T*(a two-year review of his claim in 1987. as Newspapers around the nation)Tj
T*(credulously bought the story. An editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle)Tj
T*(opined:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("The ugly possibility that discrimination played a significant role in denying)Tj
T*(the Medal of Honor to heroic American soldiers in both world wars has been)Tj
T*(raised in the extraordinary case of a Jewish veteran credited with)Tj
T*(single-handedly killing more than 500 infantrymen.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The Madison, Wisconsin, Capitol Times published an articled headlined, "WWII)Tj
T*(Soldier Started Anti-Semitism Battle Early In Life." Stories dramatizing the)Tj
T*(anti-Semitism angle appeared in publications ranging from Time magazine to the)Tj
T*(New York limes. In the meantime, it was learned that Rubitsky had signed a book)Tj
T*(contract with Warren Kozak, a reporter for National Public Radio, which had)Tj
T*(heavily publicized Rubitsky's plight. Kozak's sister, Milwaukee attorney Ellen)Tj
T*(Kozak, is a friend of the Rubitsky family.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On 8 December 1989, following an unprecedented 23-month study of his)Tj
T*(allegations, the Army concluded that Rubitsky's claim was unfounded. .The Army)Tj
T*(obtained evidence from forensic specialists and took statements from Rubitsky)Tj
T*(and 20 others who were at the scene. The Anti-Defamation League called the)Tj
T*(decision "unconscionable." Abraham Foxman said the ADL would urge Army Secretary)Tj

T*(If false charges that an individual is anti-Semitic or racist are damaging,)Tj

T*(Chicago resident had to go through such an ordeal in 1978. The United States)Tj
T*(government eventually wound up agreeing that charges should never have been)Tj
T*(filed in the first place, and paid just over half of his attorney's fees.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Frank Nalus was born in 1922 in Germany. when he was ten years old his family)Tj
T*(moved to Poland. In September 1939 the Germans invaded that country, and five)Tj
T*(months later Nalus, who was of small stature, and a group of other Polish youths)Tj
T*(were taken to Germany to work on farms. This he continued to do throughout the)Tj
T*(War. Nalus immigrated to the United States in 1963, where he was joined by his)Tj
T*(wife and three children. He became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1970.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(His nightmare began in January 1977 when he was served with papers by the U. S.)Tj
T*(Justice Department accusing him of concealing involvement in war crimes and)Tj
T*(membership in Nazi organizations when he applied for citizenship. A year later)Tj
T*(Nalus found himself in federal court, listening to testimony that implicated him)Tj
T*(in the murders of nearly two dozen civilians while acting as a German Gestapo)Tj
T*(officer during World War II.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The charges were the result of an investigation begun in 1973 by controversial)Tj
T*(Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. According to Wiesenthal, his own unnamed sources)Tj
T*(and Israeli police had learned of.a former Nazi Gestapo agent who was living in)Tj
T*(Chicago. That man was allegedly Frank Nalus. During his trial Nalus listened to)Tj
T*(utterly fantastic accounts from "eyewitnesses" imported from Israel. Moniek)Tj
T*(Rozanski, 58, for example, said he saw Nalus beat a Jewish man to death with an)Tj
T*(iron bar next to Gestapo headquarters in Poland in 1940. Joseph Koenigsberg, a)Tj
T*(resident of Tel Aviv, said he saw Nalus kill a lawyer the day after Yom Kippur)Tj
T*(in 1942. Meylich Rozenwald, a Tel Aviv shopkeeper, testified through a Yiddish)Tj
T*(language interpreter that he saw Nalus kill three persons in Kielce on 24 August)Tj
T*(1942.1 Among other allegations were that Nalus shot a mother and her two)Tj
T*(daughters in Crestochowa; that he shot three Jews who were too weak to work;)Tj
T*(that he marched 10 to 15 children, ages 4 to 9, into a building in Kielce and)Tj
T*(killed all of them with his pistol. He was also accused of killing a woman who)Tj
T*(emerged from a hospital and, when her daughter bent over her body and cried)Tj
T*("Mama, Mama," killing her, too. All of the eyewitnesses were absolutely certain)Tj
T*(that Nalus was the culprit. Newspapers reported that "they pointed to him seated)Tj
T*(at the defense table and hissed in Polish, "Here is the murderer," or "I will)Tj
T*(never forget that face.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There was just one small problem with all of this: the Justice Department, Simon)Tj

T*(Incidents directed at specific individuals are unusual. In some cases hoaxers)Tj
T*(have been "followed" from one place or residence to another by hate crime)Tj
T*(perpetrators. Disturbed individuals or attention seekers are frequently found)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(When the victims response to a hate crime is particularly skillful and)Tj

T*(very quickly, it suggests some planning was afoot. Bona fide hate crimes are)Tj

T*(reported immediately.)Tj

T*(Because of the possibility of civil damages in hate crime cases, it is likely)Tj

T*(5. Incidents which occur in improbable circumstances, such as racist graffiti in)Tj
T*(a mostly black dormitory or neighborhood, assaults that occurred in normally)Tj
T*(crowded areas with no witnesses, graffiti or vandalism in a room occupied only)Tj
T*(by the victim, and so on. Some hoaxes are surprisingly poorly planned. In)Tj
T*(several cases hoaxers had failed to dispose of incriminating evidence. The)Tj
T*(highly improbable case, where an actual hate crime would have been very)Tj
T*(difficult to pull off, is usually a hoax.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(6. In the case of graffiti, carefully drawn symbols or slurs suggest that the)Tj

T*(For reasons that are not clear, body markings on the victim by the alleged)Tj

T*(CONCLUSION)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The information I have pulled together in this report is, in my opinion, merely)Tj
T*(the tip of the iceberg. .The hoaxes I have recounted are, with a few exceptions,)Tj
T*(publicly discovered and publicly reported hoaxes. Countless more hoaxes,)Tj
T*(undiscovered and unreported, have undoubtedly also occurred.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I see no hard evidence of an organized conspiracy to commit racial and)Tj
T*(anti-Semitic hoaxes. Everything points to individuals, or small groups of)Tj
T*(individuals, as the perpetrators of hoaxes. The usefulness of hoaxes is so)Tj
T*(obvious to potential hoaxers that a conspiracy is not required to explain the)Tj
T*(large number of hoaxes or their similarities.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On the other hand, there appears to be an effort to discourage media attention)Tj
T*(to hoaxes, although this is often not successful. It appears that some hoaxes)Tj
T*(are "spiked" at the outset and others are soft-peddled once their nature is)Tj
T*(established.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Why do people commit hoaxes? There are three main reasons. The first has to do)Tj
T*(with the personal payoff for victimization, i.e., attention, sympathy, a sense)Tj
T*(of importance, feeding persecution fantasies, and material payoffs. The second)Tj
T*(has to do with advancing a political or social agenda, as in the case of hoaxes)Tj
T*(intending to create support for regulations or legislation, or to help create a,)Tj
T*(climate sympathetic to specific interest groups. The third has to do with)Tj
T*(insurance fraud, with the racial or anti-Semitic element almost an afterthought.)Tj
T*(Most hoaxes are combinations of the first two types.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Carefully done, the risk of discovery of a hoax is minimal. Most hoaxes simply)Tj
T*(remain "unsolved" hate crimes.i Those that are discovered may not result in)Tj
T*(criminal action against the hoaxers. When criminal charges are filed they can)Tj
T*(have wide ranging consequences, from long prison terms in some cases to a slap)Tj
T*(on the wrist on others, with most cases tending toward the latter.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(What can be done about hoaxes? Probably very little as long as victimization)Tj
T*(claims are so uncritically accepted, and the payoff for alleged victimization is)Tj
T*(sufficiently tempting and rewarding. "Hate crime" legislation, although)Tj
T*(well-intentioned, has created a powerful market for the side benefits of alleged)Tj
T*(hate crimes. When these crimes are not naturally occurring, or are not occurring)Tj
T*(in sufficient numbers, a motive to commit hoaxes is created. Provisions in hate)Tj
T*(crime legislation for civil damages also creates a powerful motive to commit)Tj
T*(hoaxes.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Vigilance in discovering hoaxes and appropriate publicity may discourage some)Tj
T*(potential hoaxers. Punishment for hoaxes equal to bona fide hate crimes,)Tj
T*(including sentence enhancement, would probably have a greater deterrent effect,)Tj
T*(but would also perpetuate the injustices inherent in the hate crime concept)Tj
T*(itself.)Tj

T*(Probably the most effective thing would be for universities, police agencies and)Tj
T*(the media to entertain a healthy skepticism about hate crime claims, and to)Tj

T*(Subject: The ADL Report)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(To: John Hope, III Acting Staff Director)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Attached is Ms. Gerebenics' memorandum concerning the most recent step in the)Tj
T*(review process of the ADL report. I concur in her views.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I would also like to raise several policy considerations. The ADL report does)Tj
T*(not in any way resemble a standard USCCR report. It is not a dispassionate)Tj
T*(attempt to present a K balanced accounting of facts. This Commission previously)Tj
T*(has had no difficulty in publishing reports containing defamatory information)Tj
T*(when it was verifiable and necessary to the report. Our Voting Rights Report is)Tj
T*(the most recent example. In that report, however, we did not find it necessary)Tj
T*(to mix-epithets and emotionally-laden labels with the facts. .The ADL report is)Tj
T*(rank with epithets and labels that only serve to distort the factual accountings)Tj
T*(of the activities of the KKK and similar organizations.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The liberal use of hyperbolic epithets throughout the ADL draft sets a tone that)Tj
T*(probably precludes correction through simple, adjectival laundering. The alleged)Tj
T*(inaccuracies and misrepresentations noted by the respondents present very)Tj
T*(serious problems. Of fifty-one potential defamees, we received responses from)Tj
T*(only ten, all of whom disputed the versions of events reported in the ADL draft.)Tj
T*(Most likely, references to the remaining forty-one would require additional)Tj

T*(required opportunity, there are still more than a dozen people and organizations)Tj
T*(that have not been reached. If the ten respondents are at all representative,)Tj
T*(the report probably contains many inaccuracies. It is doubtful that the report)Tj
T*(could survive the normal process of a source-check as there does not appear to)Tj
T*(be sufficient data to support the allegations.)Tj

T*(files," which could include hearsay, unverified interview notes, analyses of)Tj
T*(incidents based on newspapers, information provided by confidential sources, and)Tj
T*(so on. The basic journalistic approach of the ADL report, which borders on)Tj
T*(jingoism, requires the USCCR either to publish an unverified report that could)Tj

T*(thinking, prejudgment, and authoritarianism, has erected within you is)Tj
T*(destroyed. - Kahlil Gibran, 1923)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Roger Scruton, in the Dictionary of Political Thought defines "extremism" as:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(l. Taking a political idea "to its limits, regardless of unfortunate)Tj
T*(repercussions, impracticalities, arguments, and feelings to the contrary, and)Tj
T*(with the intention not only to confront, but to eliminate opposition.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(2. Intolerance toward all views other than one's own.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(3. Adoption of means to political ends which show disregard for.the life,)Tj
T*(liberty, and human rights of others.This definition basically reÔ¨Çects my own)Tj
T*(experience, that extremism is more an issue of style than of content. In the)Tj
T*(twenty-five years that I have been investigating political groups of the left and)Tj
T*(right, I have found that most people can hold radical or unorthodox views and)Tj
T*(still entertain them"in a more or less reasonable, rational, and non-dogmatic)Tj
T*(manner. On the other hand, I have met people whose-views were fairly close to)Tj
T*(the political mainstream but were presented. in a shrill, uncompromising,)Tj
T*(bullying, and distinctly authoritarian manner. The latter demonstrated a starkly)Tj
T*(extremist mentality while the former demonstrated only ideological unorthodoxy,)Tj
T*(which is hardly to be feared in a relatively free society such as ours.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This view of extremism, which may seem novel to many people since in today's)Tj

T*(not uniquely restricted to any particular ideology, or religion, or philosophy,)Tj
T*(or scientific viewpoint. A person may adhere to communism, existentialism,)Tj
T*(Freudianism, or the "new conservatism" in a relatively open or relatively closed)Tj
T*(manner. Thus, a basic requirement is that the concepts to be employed in the)Tj
T*(description of belief systems must not be tied to a particular belief system;)Tj
T*(they must be constructed to apply equally to all belief systems.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Rokeach goes on to say "authoritarianism and intolerance in belief and)Tj
T*(interpersonal relations are surely not a monopoly of Fascists, Anti-Semites, Ku)Tj
T*(Klux Klanners, or conservatives." I agree, and would add that the same behaviors)Tj
T*(merely take different forms and utilize different vocabulary on the "left" side)Tj
T*(of the political spectrum. The essential characteristics remain quite similar.)Tj
T*(The choice of adjectives used to describe the behavior in question often derives)Tj
T*(far more from the biases and interests of the observer than from the objective)Tj
T*(facts of the situation. Daniel Bell, the eminent sociologist and author of The)Tj
T*(Radical Right, tends to support this view. He says,)Tj
T*()Tj
T*("The way you hold beliefs is more important than what you hold. If somebody's)Tj
T*(been a rigid Communist, he becomes a rigid anti-Communist--the rigidity being)Tj
T*(constant.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In my opinion, most strident opponents of right-wing or left-wing "extremism")Tj
T*(exhibit significant ideological bias, and many are actually representatives of)Tj
T*(the opposing extreme. The fact that an extremist hates and agitates against)Tj
T*(other extremists doesn't mitigate his or her own character in this regard. In)Tj
T*(fact, opposing extremists often form a vague bond or symbolic relationship with)Tj
T*(one another, each justifying the others' existence.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In focusing on the style rather than the content of a belief system, I don't)Tj
T*(mean to imply that content is entirely irrelevant. People who tend to adopt the)Tj
T*(extremist style most often champion causes and adopt ideologies that are)Tj
T*(essentially "fringe" positions. But. mere advocacy of "fringe" positions gives)Tj
T*(our society the variety and vitality it needs to function as an open democracy,)Tj
T*(to discuss and debate all aspects of an issue, and to deal with problems that)Tj
T*(otherwise have been ignored. The extremist style is another issue altogether,)Tj
T*(however, in that it hampers our understanding of important issues, it muddies)Tj
T*(the waters of discourse with invective, defamation, self-righteousness,)Tj
T*(fanaticism, and hatred, and it impairs our ability to make intelligent,)Tj
T*(well-informed choices. Another point is that the extremist style is not only)Tj
T*(found at the fringes of the political or religious spectrum, but sometimes in)Tj
T*(the "middle" as well. An individual who is uncompromisingly and intolerantly)Tj
T*("centrist" may be far more dogmatic and prejudiced than someone who adopts more)Tj
T*(radical views but does so in a open and tolerant manner.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Consequently, a guarded middle-of-the-road position doesn't necessarily provide)Tj
T*(a solution to extremism, and in some cases can only serve as a mask to conceal)Tj
T*(it. In fact, it could be argued that those beliefs that are accorded legitimacy)Tj
T*(by consensus, which is to say that everyone unthinkingly accepts them, may even)Tj
T*(be more prone to appear on the extremist agenda and more difficult to challenge)Tj
T*(or effectively debate. When the word "extremist" is used as an epithet it)Tj
T*(usually represents points of view with which we disagree, advocated by someone)Tj
T*(we dislike \(but usually don't know\) and whose interests are contrary to our)Tj
T*(-own. Political ideologues and special interests often attempt definitions of)Tj
T*("extremism" that specifically condemn the views of their critics and opponents)Tj
T*(while leaving their own equally strident and intolerant behavior untouched. In)Tj
T*(the debate over abortion, for example, one side or the other will condemn)Tj
T*(opponents as "extremists" while describing themselves as valiant defenders of)Tj
T*(human life or champions of freedom. In fact, bona  de extremist elements exist)Tj

T*(The traits of "extremists")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Robert F. Kennedy wrote:)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are)Tj
T*(extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their)Tj
T*(cause, but what they say about their opponents.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In analyzing the rhetoric and propaganda of several hundred militant "fringe")Tj
T*(political and social groups across the political spectrum, I have identified a)Tj
T*(number of specific traits or behaviors that tend to represent the extremist)Tj
T*("style." Other writers have delineated various extremist traits and where their)Tj
T*(criteria have been objective I have included them.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I am especially indebted to professors John George and Gordon" Hall for their)Tj
T*(suggestions. Please let me caution you with the admonition, that we are all)Tj
T*(fallible human beings and anyone, without bad intentions, may resort to some of)Tj
T*(these behaviors from time to time. With bona fide extremists, however, these)Tj
T*(lapses are not occasional. Rather, they are a habitual and strongly established)Tj
T*(part of their repertoire, so much so that in some cases their entire belief)Tj
T*(system is expressed in these terms, including a polemical style that is fairly)Tj
T*(easy to identify.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(l. Character assassination. Extremists often attack the character of an opponent)Tj
T*(rather than deal with the facts or issues raised. They will question motives,)Tj
T*(qualifications, past associations, alleged values, personality, looks, mental)Tj
T*(health, and so on as a diversion from the issues under consideration. Some of)Tj
T*(these matters are not entirely irrelevant, but they should not serve to avoid)Tj
T*(the real issues. Extremists object strenuously when this is done to them, of)Tj
T*(course!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(2. Name calling and labeling. Extremists are quick to resort to epithets)Tj
T*(\(racist, subversive, pervert, hatemonger, nut, crackpot, degenerate,)Tj
T*(un-American, anti-semite, red, commie, nazi, kook, crank, liar, bigot, and so on\))Tj
T*(to label and condemn opponents in order to divert attention from their arguments)Tj
T*(and to discourage others from hearing them out. These epithets don't have to be)Tj
T*(proved to be effective; the mere fact that they have been said is often enough.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(3. Irresponsible sweeping generalizations. Extremists tend to make sweeping)Tj
T*(claims or judgments on little or no evidence, and they have a tendency to)Tj
T*(confuse similarity with sameness. That is, they assume that because two \(or)Tj
T*(more\) things, events, or persons are alike in some respects, they must be alike)Tj
T*(in most respects. The sloppy use of analogy is a treacherous form of logic and)Tj
T*(has a high potential for false conclusions.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(4. Inadequate proof for assertions. Extremists tend to be very fuzzy about what)Tj
T*(constitutes proof, and they also tend to get caught up in logical fallacies,)Tj
T*(such as post hoc ergo propter hoc \(assuming that a prior event explains a)Tj
T*(subsequent occurrence simply because of their before-and-after relationship\).)Tj
T*(They tend to project wished-for conclusions and to exaggerate the significance)Tj
T*(of information that confirms their beliefs while derogating or ignoring)Tj
T*(information that contradicts them. They tend to be motivated by feelings more)Tj
T*(than facts, by what they want to exist rather than what actually does exist.)Tj

T*("Extremists do a lot of wishful and fearful thinking.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(5. Advocacy of double standards. Extremists generally tend to judge themselves)Tj
T*(or their interest group in terms of their intentions, which they tend to view)Tj
T*(generously, and others by their acts, which they tend to view very critically.)Tj
T*(They would like you to accept their assertions on faith, but they demand proof)Tj
T*(for yours. They tend to engage in special pleading on behalf of themselves or)Tj
T*(their interests, usually because of some alleged special status, past)Tj
T*(circumstances, or present disadvantage.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(6. Tendency to view their opponents and critics as essentially evil. To the)Tj
T*(extremist, opponents hold opposing positions because they are bad people,)Tj
T*(immoral, dishonest, unscrupulous, mean-spirited, hateful, cruel, or whatever,)Tj
T*(not merely because they simply disagree, see the matter differently, have)Tj
T*(competing interests, or are perhaps even mistaken.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(7. Manichean worldview. Extremists have a tendency to see the world in terms of)Tj
T*(absolutes of good and evil, for them or against them, with no middle ground or)Tj
T*(intermediate positions. All issues are ultimately moral issues of right and)Tj
T*(wrong, with the "right" position coinciding with their interests. Their slogan)Tj
T*(is often "those who are not with me are against me ")Tj
T*()Tj
T*(8. Advocacy of some degree of censorship or repression of their opponents and])Tj
T*(or critics. This may include a very active campaign to keep opponents from media)Tj
T*(access and a public hearing, as in the case of blacklisting, banning, or)Tj
T*("quarantining" dissident spokespersons. They may actually lobby for legislation)Tj
T*(against speaking, writing, teaching, or instructing "subversive" or forbidden)Tj
T*(information or opinions. They may even attempt to keep offending books out of)Tj
T*(stores or off of library shelves, discourage advertising with threats of)Tj
T*(reprisals, and keep spokespersons for "offensive" views off the airwaves or)Tj
T*(certain columnists out of newspapers. In each example the goal is some kind of)Tj
T*(information control. Extremists would prefer that you listen only to them. They)Tj
T*(feel threatened when someone talks back or challenges their views.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(9. Tend to identify themselves in terms of who their enemies are: whom they hate)Tj
T*(and who hates them. Accordingly, extremists may become emotionally bound to)Tj
T*(their opponents, who are often competing extremists themselves. Because they)Tj
T*(tend to view their enemies as evil and powerful, they tend, perhaps)Tj
T*(subconsciously, to emulate them, adopting the same tactics to a certain degree.)Tj
T*(For example, anti-Communist ,and anti-Nazi groups often behave surprisingly like)Tj
T*(their opponents. Anti-Klan rallies often take on much of the character of the)Tj
T*(stereotype of Klan rallies themselves,'including the orgy of emotion, bullying,)Tj
T*(screaming epithets, and even acts of violence. To behave the opposite of someone)Tj
T*(is to actually surrender your will to them, and "opposites" are often more like)Tj
T*(mirror images that, although they have "left" and "right" reversed, look and)Tj
T*(behave amazingly alike.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(10. Tendency toward argument by intimidation. Extremists tend to frame their)Tj
T*(arguments in such a way as to intimidate others into accepting. their premises)Tj
T*(and conclusions. To disagree with them is to "ally oneself with the devil," or)Tj

T*(grasping for certainty in an uncertain world, or an attempt to achieve absolute)Tj
T*(security in an environment that is naturally unpredictable or perhaps populated)Tj

T*(19. Inclination toward "groupthink." Extremists, their organizations, and their)Tj
T*(subcultures are prone to a kind of inward-looking group cohesiveness that leads)Tj
T*(to what Irving Janis discussed in his excellent book Victims of Groupthink.)Tj
T*("Groupthink" involves a tendency to conform to group norms and to preserve)Tj
T*(solidarity and concurrence at the expense of distorting members' observations of)Tj

T*("other side." The result is a deterioration of reality-testing, rationality, and)Tj
T*(moral judgment. With groupthink, shared illusions of righteousness, superior)Tj
T*(morality, persecution, and so on remain intact, and those who challenge them are)Tj
T*(viewed with skepticism and hostility.)Tj

T*(20. Tendency to personalize hostility. Extremists often wish for the personal)Tj
T*(bad fortune of their "enemies," and celebrate when it occurs. When a critic or)Tj
T*(an adversary dies or has a serious illness, a bad accident, or personal legal)Tj
T*(problems, extremists often rejoice and chortle about how they "deserved" it. I)Tj

T*(21. Extremists often feel that the system is no good unless they win. For)Tj

T*(Thus, extremists tend to have these things in common:)Tj

T*(Extremism tends to be "feelings-based" rather than "evidence-based," although the)Tj
T*(selective use of evidence may obscure that fact.)Tj

T*(2. They try to discourage critical examination of their beliefs by a variety of)Tj
T*(means, usually by false logic, rhetorical trickery, or some kind of censorship,)Tj

T*(3. Extremism usually represents some attempt to act out private personal grudges)Tj
